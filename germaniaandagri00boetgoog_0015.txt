fectly a liberty to express his opinion of the velue
of those materials. The notes of Walchs 1n particu-
lar, on the Agricola, which consist, int the original,
of more than three hundred closely printed octavo
peges, form undoubtedly, as has been remarked by
the English editor‚“ one of the most valueble com-
mentaries ever published upon any classical author.”

'⁴ The ‘⁴ Remarks on-the Style of Tacitus,'’ appended

to the English edition, and reprinted in this, are trans-
lated from a work of Biitticher, ‘⁶ De vita, scriptis, cc
stilo Taciti '⁹ Berlin 1834, and which to borrow again
the language of Dr. Smith,“ is well known to be a
very excellent introduct tion to tha study of the style
and writings of Tacitusl' The Geographioel Index
is confined, as will be perceived, to the Germania, and
enters somewhat fully mto the subsequent movements
of the German tribes. The Geographyof Britain,
being of minor importence, has been explained at
once in the notest theo Agricola. Tha materiels for

’ the ludex have been obtained rn a great measure from

the commentary in the English edition, and the pres-
ent work will be found to heve gained m this way a
decided advantage by the separation of the geograph-
ical from ‘tha explanatory matter. It is a great, but
very common mistake, to suppose that the ancient
Geography of Germany and Britain, especially the ·
former, requires at the' present day but little elucida-
tion. The student needs' only to turn over a few
pages of Mannert to perceiva how utterly erroneous
is such an opinion.

It remeius but to give a list os the different editions
of Tacitus, as well as of the other works from which
aid hasbeen obtained for the present volume.
