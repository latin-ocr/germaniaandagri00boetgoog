Thtringer Wald. The latter is the more probable. In tbe Mid-
dle Ages, the forest extending from Fulda to the Thuringer Wald
bore tbe name os Buchoni‘a. The Sala Franeouioe, with the Sper·
sart and 11111111 Gebirge, formed the boundary between them and
tbe Hermunduriimnnal„ xiii., 57). On the east their territories
were bounded by the Werra. On tbe south they reached to the
Maya and the Hercynian Forest. Alter they toolr possession os the
district abandoned by the Ubii when they orossed.¹ the Rhine, their
territory extended to that river, between the Luta and the Mayn.
On the north they bordered on a branch os the Cruci, so tbat the
Weser formed their boundary in this direction. On the west tbe
Tencteri were their neighbors; sothat in this quarter they reached
to the Mount Abnoba os Ptolemy (see c. 28). Thus their territory
comprehended that os the modern Horridus, Fuldc, the eatldoms ol
Honore and Irenlorg, so much os Franconio as lies north os the Mayn
to the mouth os the Saule, part of Nasson, and the eastern portion
os the Ducty of Wertplraliu. Their principal towns were Noroterov
(Nimbus), in Wartplrulicy Μηλὸκαυος (Melsclrede); and Τραυῐονάριον

Ptolemy divide them into the greater arrd the less: though Tacitus
does not maire this distinction here, be allodes to it iubis Annals

assigna them rather narrower limits; as in his time the western
cauci were more confined than in the age ol Tacitus. The Oaucl
