Omnem. The German tribe of the Cherusci must he many
distingvushed from the lengue of the Cherusci. As a tribe, their
possemions lay in the Harz Μουνάτιε, and on both sides of thena
but chiefly on the south, where the northwest part of the Theringer
Wald separated them froin the Gatti. The Sala (Scae) probably
formed their eastern boundary3 so that their territory comprehend-
ed ibe Duritia of Braneroiok aud Mcgdeborffi with tue Paesinates
of Hclderetadt, &inaniora Gradenboyen, and Cainobery. The
name Hcrz is derived by sorus from that of Cherusci: in the Peu-
tingeriau Table they are called Otheretini. (See Ptol, ii., ll ; eas,
B. G.. vi, ltl; Soada vii, 1, 3, 4.) Ptolemy places them only ou
tus south eide of the Ham Mountaine; but the expeditione of Ger·
manicos show that they dwelt on the north side also. A wall budt
between the arsinoae See and the Weser separated them from the
Angrivarii (Aac, ii., 19). The Alter probably formed their bound·
ary on the north and cast, up to the point where it meets the hiae.
They were at first in alliauee with Rome, and Arminius commanded
asquadmn of German cavalry in'the Roman army, and so far dis·
tingnisbed himself that he was made a Roman knight. Asterward,
roused by this dementire Cherusci joined the Cotti audothers in
the attach upon Varus ς for a history oi which, see Ana, i, tte-em
’ ii., 9-26. They were afterward defeated by Germanicus (Ana, ii,
1⁷). Their strength, however, was not much broken; for the fol·
lewing year they defeated the Marcomanni under Maroboduus, and
were now, through the courage and conduct of Arminius, the first
people in Germany. The Cheruscan league included the Dulgibini,
Ansibarii, Chasuari, Chamavi, Tubantes, and Marsi. These and
other small tribes are frequently called cherusci. Thus the land
. between the sources of the Lippa and the Werer, in all the accounts
,of the transactions before the defeat of Varus, is called the land oi
the Cherusci. But the power and iuduence which Arminius had

’ aequired roused the jealousy of other princes, and he was murdered

by some of his own family. With him fell the greatness of the Che·
rusci. Internal dissensione ruined the whole family of their ancient
princes. In the reign of Claudius they sent to Rome to ask, as king,
italicus, a descendant of the family of Arminius, who was born at
nome. Being, however, loohed'upon as an alien, he was driven
out, but was reinstated by the Langobardi (Ana, xi, 16, 17). Their
tenue was speedily dissolved; feuds arose between them and tbe
neighboring tribes, and a considerable portion of their territory was
wrested froin them by the Langobardi, and they were driven from
tue west of the Tturevger Wald by the Gatti. Ptolcmymeutions.·
