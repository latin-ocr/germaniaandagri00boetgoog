Fenus agitare, dic. “To lend out money upon interest, and to
increase it by means of usurious practices, is unknown (among ’
them).” The expression ia usuras is a poetic one for amris'or per
usurus. Commentators make a great difficulty with this simple
passage. Their various opinions may bc seen stated by Weisheupt,
p. 379. One of the worm of these is that advanced by Walther,

Ι who makes senus have here the meaning merely οἷ’ι εαρίιεῌ a
signification which ³}Fffflfffld correctly remarkss rs extremely rare
Tacitus rs silently compartng German with Roman manners At
Rome the most exorbitant usury was practiced, whereas the Ger·
mans are here described as not only strangam to nsurious exactione,
but even to the lending out of money on interest at all.

Ideoque magis serentur, dic. ‘⁴ And, therefore, the abetaining from ¹

· · had been forbidden bylaw” A remarkable instance of conciseness
in the original, which can not be imitated in atranslation. The ref·
erenoe to what, precedes is rather a mental than agrammatical one,
and we must, therefore, supply with screator some such expression
es abstinentia a scabre agitando. On this usage of language, consult
the remarks of Perizonius, ad Subit. Misero, iv, 8, note v. Some
commentatore give secatur here the meaning of “is provided
against,” “ is ‘avoided” without any ellipsis; but for this there is
no authority-Lege vetitum esset. Usury was forbidden at Rome,
though in vain, by the laws of the Twelve Tables, and by various
enactments made by Licinius, Genucius, Sempronius, Julius Cesar,
and others. The Germane were sree from it, on account of their
little acquaintance with moneyed transactione. ⁴

Agri, pro numero cultorum, dic. “The lande are occupied by
whole communities in turn, according to the number of persons to
till them.” The true reading here is undoubtedly in vices, and the
meaning of the passage is, that the same territories were occupied
by different tribes or communities in tumfto a greater or less ex·
tent, according to the number of persons to till them. The best
commentary on Tacitus here is to be found in the account given by
Caesar of the Suevi (Β. G, iv, l). Some commentatore, however,
disregarding the authority of Coesar, read eicis for in vices, and think
that the Germane did not live in the manner os nomed tribes to such
a degree es is commonly supposed; but that individuals had pos·
sessiom of their own, which they retained, without aoy oftbo ex·
