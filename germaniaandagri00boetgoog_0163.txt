OHAPTER XXX.

Ultra bor. Tacitus means, beyond the tribes already mentioned
as dwelling on‘or near the Rhine; not those occupying the Drou-
nretrr ogra-Cotti initium redd, dcc. “The Catii make the first
rude beginning os their settlements from the Hercynian Forest.'’
Mannert refers this to a chain oi the Ham Mouutains, running north

from the Maio sor a considerable distance. (Gorg-r, vol. iii, p. 183.)
Observa the peculiar force oi the expression initiam inchoant, which
isby no means pleonaatic, aa many suppose. The verb inchoare
strictly refers to the first shetcb or rode outline of any work, or to
the iirst rude commenoement os any thing, and is bare peculiarly
apposite. (Compare Oia, da Oa, i., 2, 5: ‘⁸ Quo melancholia noha
“mmmcmlhnoahiaiothoatcaomdicencidrrentffi The territory
of the Oatti comprehended that oi the modern Hessians, Fulda‚ tbe

1 eartooms oi Hanau and Isenburg, so much os Franconia as lies north

of the Maln, to the mouth of the Saale, part of Nassau, and the east·
ern portion os the Duchy of westphalia. (consult Geograpbical
index.)

Effusis. “Level.”-Io quaa Gerrunio parerent. “Into which
Germanyspreadsitseli‘’-Daroot conmendatio. “Sincebills
continue on (here) in along range, and (then) gradually become
scattered.” Observa the beautiful figure in dorca, and compare
the remarks oi sarreia, Lar. Tae, p. 165. Passow, Hess, Diltbey,
and others place a colon atter dorent, thus connecting ¹it with what

s precedes, and making aalma ita subject, “ as the other states en·

dure to dwell in.’' ln the succeeding clause they read siquidem
collerpaallatimrarercaat. This, however, issar inferior-Siquidem.
The position oi this word, as the second in tbe sentence, is in ac·
eordance with the habit os transposition in which Tacitus so fre·
quently indulges. (Compare wimiis, de Elaearionr Taciti,- and
Gerlach, ad loe.) The proper placa oi riqaim would be tba first iu
the sentence.

Et Cattos anor, dno. “ And the Hercynian Forest both eseorts and
sets down ite own Catti.’¹ Abold and lively image. Whenamag-
