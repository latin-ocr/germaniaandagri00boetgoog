Some ol the Boii appear to have accompanied them in their inva-
sion of Italy. Their name is still preserved iu the national appel·
lation of the Welsh, Gymry. It is very difficult to decide whether
the Cimbri were a Germanic or a Celtic tribe. The two races were ·
not carelully ‘distinguished by the Romans: Tacitus called them
Germaus; but the Cymry certainly are not descendants ol the Ger-
mane: their language isa Celtic dialect. In the war with Marius
they were led hya Celtic commender, and the description of their
artus points to the same origin. Yet we lind them united with tbe ·
Teutones. There is a similar difficulty in the ease ol the Belga.

Dior. A tribe living between the Danube and the Carpathiae
Mountains, about the Rivers Tibiscus and Merisus (Teis and dda-
rearb)‚ in the upper part os Hungcry, Transyloaaio, Moldoor'a, Wal-
loclu'c, and Brrrcralia. The first expedition os the Emperor TraJ‘an
was against the Daoi, headed by theirking, Decebalus; and the war,
which lasted nearly five years, ended in their submission, AD. 105
(Dio Cass, lxviii, 6, app), to the Roman power. ⁴ One of their chief
towns, Sarmizegethusa‚ was atterward called Ulpia Trajani, in
memory of the-victory which was gained. In AD. 250, Dacia was
overrun and conquered by the Goths, to whom it was afterward re·
signedbytheEmperorAurelian. Domitian celebratedhispreteuded
exploits against the Dacians by assuming the title Dacicus (Iao,
Sat.‚vi.,2⁰4) .. ........ c.l
· Duronius. The largest river iu Europe except the Rha, or Volgo,
called by the Germane Dorou, hy the Hungarians Dana, and by the
English Danube. Strabo and Pliny make it rIse in the chain os
Mons Abnoba, apertos the Black Ferret. According to modern ac· ’
counts, it originates on the eastern declivity of the Black Forest,
about twenty-four miles from the banks os the Rhine. Its course
is calculated to be about one thousand seven hundred and seventy
miles before it enters the Black Sea, and it receives sixty navi·
gable rivers, the largest ol which is the OEnus, or Ian, and ono
hundred aud twenty emaller streame. As regards the etymology

ι os the name, it may be remarked, that Bayer (Comme. Acod. Petrop,

vol. ix, p. 375) supposes an early people to have existed, in whose

language a word like Tan, Tou, Dcn, or Domi ruay have signified
⁴⁶ water,’' from which were gradually derived such names of rivers
as Tanais, Danaperis‚ Demeter, Danubius, non, Eridanus, Rhodan-
