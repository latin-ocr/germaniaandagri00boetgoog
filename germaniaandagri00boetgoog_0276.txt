were friends os the Romam in the expedition 31 Drusus, and still
more so in that 31 Tiberius (Ana, i., 60; ii, 17). Even atter the
disaster of Varus, they continued their friendship‚ and Germanicus
made all his expeditione against the Cherusci srorn this side. But
bere, again, the Romans rnused the eumity 31 their allies, by pur-
suing the same policy as in the case 31 the Frisii. Under Gannas-
cus, they crossed the Rhine, and made incursione on the Roman
province 31 Germania Inferior (dnn, xi„ 18) ; but were repulsed by
Corbulo. They asterward aided Civilis in the Batavian war (Hirr, ·
iv., 79; v., 19). Eveu allertbe expulsion 31 the Romans, they oon-
tinued the enemies 31 the Cherusci, and felt themselves powerlul
enough to drive this people from the west bank 31 the Wesen, while
they ejected the Ansibarii (Aen, xiii, 55), ’3311 perhaps sorno more
southerly brancbes 31 the Cherusci, from their possessions along the
Weser; and it is only aner this that the remark 31 Tacitus applies ⁸
13 them, that tbe southern angle 31 their territory bordered on one
side on tbe Cherusci, and ou the other on the 03111. lint tbe Lan-
gobardi, pressing westward 13 tbe Rhine‚ established themselves in
all the lands which bad belonged to the Cherusci and their allies;
and in the time 31 Ptolemy tbe cauci were reduced within their ¹
original boundaries. Ptolemy (11, limentinus, as their towns,

Cnnnlvr. A §erman tribe, who originally occupied the tract
which extended northward to the Vecb, eastward to the Eam, south·

ward to tbe Lippa, and westward to the eastern mouth 31 the Rhine. ,

At a later period they lived between tbe Weser and the Harz Monal-
ur'rra, in Eicbseld, and a partos Grubenbagen and Hobenatein. In the
third century they are again found on tbe Rhine, as members 31
the Frank league; and in tbe next century they spread themselves
along the Waol. Tacitus has most probably committed amistake
in placing them in the country 31 the Bructeri. (Compare Manum,
