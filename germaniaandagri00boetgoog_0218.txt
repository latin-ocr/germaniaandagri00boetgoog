sense by Caesar (B. G, iii, 5): “ Tua· tantors <plicia maritimo Bibulus

Suetonius lrr'rrc Paulinus, &n “From this time Suetonius Pauli·
nus enjoyed prosperans fortune for two years, in the subjection of
tribes and the establishment of garrisons.” We must be careful

not to translate “after the rebellione tribes had been subdued‚” as ,

trace of the name Mona still remains in that os the Menai strait.
The Mona of Tacitus was the chief seat of the Druidical religion in
Britain, and was, on this account, attached by Paulinus, who wish-
ed to put an end, by these means, to the influence exercised by the
Druid priesthood ovar the minds of the Britons, in stiming them up
to oppositinn against the Romans. Paulinus took the island, and
destroyed the graves in which human sacrifices wera accustomed
to be offered. For a spirited slretch of tha affair, consult Anu, xiv,
{ld-Vires. “Parcas’' Tacitus says that the island was power-
fulin its inhabitants (incolis solidant—Terga nonunt patefecit.
“Laid open tn a surprise the settlements behind him.” Tacitus
alludes to the rcrolt of the Britons unde'r Bnallicea, of which an
account is given ja Anu, xiv, 31, as well as in the two following
chapters of the present work.
