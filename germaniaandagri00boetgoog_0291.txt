Maroboduus, who, in his youth, had corneto Rome and been edu·
cated at the court of Augustus. He raised his people to a high
pitch os prosperis, and formed a league including a great number

’ ’ ot' the Suevic tribes, ci which the Langobardi and Semnones were

the most northerly. His power had become formidable to Rome,
and Tiberius prepared to invado his dominicus. But a sudden in-
surrection oi the Pannonian and Dalmatiae tribes compelled Tibe·
rius ιο concludo a treaty with him (Veli, ii, los-1103 Aac, ii., 16).
The Langobardi and Semnones having withdrawn from Marobo-
duus, and attached themselves to Arminius, the chief of the Che·
rusci, awar ensued between thern. Inguiomerus, the uncle oiAr-
miniuscame over to Maroboduus, who was defeated, and compell-
ed to retirc among the Marcomanni, and apply to Rome for assist-
ance (Aoo, ii, 44-46). Ιι appears thata peace was then concluded
between them. Maroboduus was scon aller expelled by Catualda,
and forced to take refuge in Italy: he lived there, at Ravenna, sor
eighteen years. Catualda was driven ont by theHermundun, and
also tled to Tiberius ior protection. The followers os these two
princes were settled beyond the Danube, between the Morosa and
Gran, and Vannius, from the tribe ci the Quadi, was appointed as
their king (Aba, ii, 62, ⁶33 xii, 29, 30 3‘ Hice, iii, b). Posce was
maintained between the Romans and ¹the tribes along the Danube
till the reign os Domitian, when hostilities broke out, and continued
almost uninterruptedly till the* destruction ot* the Romm Empire
