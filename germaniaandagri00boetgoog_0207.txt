tirely free from‚” aud make the language nf Tacitus have a general
applicaticn to the character of Agricola. There is no authority, how-

what comes aster, namely, “integritatem elprae abstinentiam ia tanto
viro referre, injuria virtutum fuerit.” (Compare Watah‚ad loa.)-Fa·
vilitas. “Affability.”

‘Iadatgeaa “Court.''-Per artem. By means of such arts as
governors frequently employ to secure the good-will of their pro
vincial subjects. There is an allusion, perhaps, also, to addresses
of thanks from the inhabitants of the province to the emperor, dur-
ing and after the time of administration. (Compare Dic Cass.. lvi,
253 Arra, xv, 22.)-Callegas. Magistrates who were created at
the same comitia, and, when these were no longer held, by the scn-
ate aud emperors, were called collega. So in Hiar, ii, 10, the col·
langues of Mucianus are the govemors of iudea, Cappadocia, and

prefects, especially those appointed over the Gallie and Spauish
provinces—Procuratores. Each province had only one procurator

emdidam arbitrabatur. ‘⁶ He thought that (in such disputes as these)
both ιο conquer was attended with no glory, and to be worstdd
wasa positive disgrace.'’ Observe here the peculiar force of adteri,
which answers thus tc tbe Greek ἐλασσοῦσθαι, aud is used of any
infringemepf upon a person’s dignity, or the respect and attention
ιο which he has a claim.
