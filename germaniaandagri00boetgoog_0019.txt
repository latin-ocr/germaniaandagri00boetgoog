he was appointed Consul Suffectus, and Pliny enumeratas it as the
crowning event to the good fortune os Virginius, that his panegyric
was pronounced by the Oonsnl Cornelius Tacitus, the most eloquent
of speakers. ' “
“ Tacitus is recorded by his friend Pliny as one os the most eloquent
oratore os his age. He had already attained te some distinction aa
an advocate when Pliny was commencing his career. In the reign
of Nerva, Pliny and Tacitus were appointed bytho senate (A.D. 99)
to conduct the prosecution of Marius Priscus, who had been proconsul
oi Africa, and was charged with various flagrant crimes. On this

¹ occasion Tacitus replied to Salvius Liberalis, who had spoken in de·

sance oi Priscus. His reply‚ says Pliny, was most eloquent, and
marked by that dignity which characterized his style of speaking.
(Prin, Ep, ii, 11.)

¹ ⁴⁴ The contemporaries of Tacitus were Quintilian, the two Plinies,
Julius Florus, Maternus, Μ. Aper, and Vipsanius Messala. He was
on terma oi the greatest intimacy with the younger Pliny, in whose
extant collection os letters there are eleven epistles from 'Pliny tu
Tacitus. In one of these letters (vi, 16) Pliny describes the circum·
stanes oi the death of his uncle, Pliny the elder, and the letterwas
pnrposely written to supply Tacitus with sacta for his historical works.
Itis not known when Tacitus died, nor whether he left any children.
The Emperor Tacitus claimed the honor os being descended from him,
·, but we have no means of jndging of the accuracy of the emperor's
² pedigre03 and Sidonius Apollinaris (Ep, lib. iv, cd Polemicm) men-
tions the historiari Tacitis among the ancestors os Polemios, a prefect
oi Gaul in the fisth century of our era.

⁴⁴The extant works os Tacitus are the ‘Life oi Agricola,’ ⁴the
Treatise on the Germans,' ⁴ Historias,' ‘Annala’ aad the ‘Ridogne on
Orators; or, the Gauses of the Declineof Eloquence.’ ⁴ one os his
. Oratione are preserved.

‘⁴ The ‘Life oi Agricola’ isone of the earliest works oi Tacitus, and
must bave been written atter the death oi Domitian (An. 96). The
Prooemium, or Introduction to it, wne written in the reign ci Trajan,
and the whole work probably belongs to the first orsecond year of
that emperor’s reign. As a specimen oi biography, it is much and
justly admired. Like all the extant works oi Tacitus, it is nnencum- ⁸
bared with minuta irrelevant maner. The lite and portrait oi Agricola
aresketched in abold and rigoruus style, correspondiug to the dig·
city of the subject The biographer was the friend and son-in-law os
Agricola, whom he loved aad revered, but he impressas his reader

y with aproionud conviction os the moral gmatness of Agricola hil

courage, aad his prudence, without ever beccming hit pwflssyfl'lt·
