ΟΝ THE FORCll AND BREVITY OF THE STYLE Ol*
TACITUS.

All agree, without any hesitation, that the pecnliar character of
'l'aoitus's style is seen most iu the concise brevity of his langueg03
and those who have looked into it more closely, till they have even
explored all the inmost recesses ol his sometimes abrnpt diction, pre·
fer Tacitus to all other writers for this very reason, and adrnire the
divine aspect ol his genius, which, the nearer they approach it, and -
the more intently they hang upon its contemplation, so much the
more deeply penetratas the minda os the beholders. But if yon ask

whence proceeds end what means that taciturn brevity, and where·
fore it is that you are sometimes moved by it in the inmost corner of

your heart, seelr the answer from semel life, both that of Tacitus and
your owns Many were then (as now they are, if we would honest·
ly confess it) the saults, the vices, the crimes oi men, with bnt rare
examples os substantial, well-tried virtne; great were envy and the
ignorance osright; many were the mockeries that were made of the
affairs of men, and the empty dissensione cs the populnee; while hut
very lew then, as in our own time even hy uo means all, were seek·
ing better· and higher things. And as it by no meaos becomes ns,
who are hlessed with the hopes and consolatione of the Christian
nith, to monrn over those things which are faulty in our own age
,with the seme grief as nat with which we behold a Roman, who ao·
counted nothing to be lollier and granden than tho hereditary glory
and mnjesty ol his country, mourniug over the common corruption ol
all things, eud over the republic falling heedlong tc ruin3 so we sure-
ly carr not blame in Tacitus that kind ot* hitter pleesnre, and that in·

tonius, impose teo heavy a burdeu on hie own end his renders’ sense '
ol shame by narrating every thing at length with a disgnsting loqua-
