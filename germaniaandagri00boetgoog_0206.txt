accustomed in military lise, did not at all intersere with his useiul-
ness as ajudge when he came to preside in a civil tribunal. The
allusion here is to the conventus juridici, or circuit¹courts (assizes),
in which Agricola, as governor oi the province, was now called ιο
preside. (Gronov, Obstru, iii, 22.)—Togator. The term togati ia
here equivalent, in effect, to litigaotrs; sor suits could only becarried
on in the toga, and in Latin. It does not mean lawyers or advo
cates alone, or citizens merely in opposition to soldiers. (Compare
Walelt,adloe.)

Jom raro. “From this time, indecor-coarantes. “The oir-
cuits.” In order to facilitate the administration οι justice, aRomau
province was divided into a number of districts or circuite, each of
which was called conventas, soram, or jurisdictio. At these enarrator
litigant parties applied to the proconsul, or governor, who presided
in them, and this officer selected a number of judges, from the per·
sons assemhled, to try their causes. The proconsul pronounced sen·

duty.”—Nolla oltra potestatis persora. ’“ There was no playing the

requirement of respect, and undinehing severity in exacting what

of disposition, nor asperity ol manners, but the sternness which be·
seems a magistrate and high public iunctionary. So, again, by ar·
rogantia, as here employed, we are to understand, not the assump-
tion oi what does not belong to a person, but the rigid exactiori of
all the respect and attention to which he has a claim. The term
arsatio has here its ordinary meaning. Agricola was not naturally
avaras, any more than he was tristis or arrogans5 but he was
obliged to comply with the commanda oi Vespasian, who was likely
enough to replenish his exhausted coffers by exactione from this
wealthyprovince. (Compare Hist, ii.,st; Soet, Vesp, 16.) Aro-
