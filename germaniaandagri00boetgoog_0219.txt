-Siogoio's siti oliot, duc. ⁴‘ That formerly they had only one king
sor each nation.” Observe the soros os singulos, one scr each na-
tion ; not merely one king, which would he onum rogem-Scoiret.
Observe the employment of the subjunctive, as indicating the sen-
timenta of the speaker, not those of the writer—AEqoe discordiam
prepositorum, dvc. “That in an equal degree did the discord ot
those placed over them, iu an equal degree did their union prove de·
structive to those subjected to their sway.’' Observa here the em·
ployment of aeqoc. . . . oeqoe. So we have puriter. . . pariter in ovid

emendations which different editors have proposed. The whole
question is sully discussed in Walch's note.

lo proelio fortiorem esse qui spoliet. “That in battle it is the
hraver man who despoils.’' Observe‚ again, the employment os the
subjunctive in spoliet, as indicating the sentiments os the speaker,
notos the writes-Tamquam mori tontum, dic. “Asis they were
ignorant only how to die ior their native land.” Compare the anal·
, ogous Greek constructiones ὡς with tho absolute case os the par-
ticiple.

Quium. “How mereahandsul.’' One ot the MSS. has quon-
tolum, the correction of some copyist who was ignorant that is, talis,
tantus, quantos, and the like, are employed to express diminution as
