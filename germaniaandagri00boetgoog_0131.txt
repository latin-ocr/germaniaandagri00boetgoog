Civilis to drive the Romam from Gaul. Her influence was very
great among all classes oi the Germane, and she contributed by her
predictions to some of their most brilliant successes. She was sur·
rendered to the Romans, however, by her own countrymen, perhaps
by Civilis himself, and Statius (l. a.) alludes to her eaptivity. She
is said to have dwelt in atower, according to some in a caveata
place now called Spillmierg, on the right bank ol the Luppia or
Lippa. Various explanatione have been given os the name, some
of which may be seen in *Ryckius ad Tac, Hier, iv, 61, p. 444.
Dilthey makes it signisy “a female inhabitant of the sorest’‘ (Weid-

being supposed to be omniscient. (Diltlaey, ad loa.) Hence, in all
likelihood, the conjecture os Lipsius, namely, Alacritatem, os which
Secbode approves‚ preseuts us with the true reading here. lornan-
des, moreover (Goth, c. 24), speaks oi the German women called
Aliorum, a term equivalent as he informs us, to ‘⁶ maga mulierar.”

companied Masyus‚ king of the Semnones, ιο Rome in the time of
Domitian, and was very honorably received. (Dio Casa, lxvii, 5.)

about the religion of the ancient Germane. The few notices we
hare respecting it are chiefly in tbe writings os the Greeks and Ro-
mans, who did not understand their language, and, with very few
exceptione, had never visited the country; or iu those os the Christ·
