debert (Deerit, l. 15). Some, less correctly, explain the present
passage so as to mean, that the whole ol the family of the injured
person receives part of the fine ; others, that by the payment os the
fine to the prosecutor the vengeance os the whole family is satisfied.
The use ol recipere in the sense os “to make one’s sels responsible

Cam defecere. ‘¹ When the means os entertainment have sassed,”
i. e., have become exhausted. Supply epula-'Monstrum hospitii
