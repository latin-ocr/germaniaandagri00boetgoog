words extremo jam litore Tacitus alludes to the narrow isthmus be·
tween the Clota (Clytie) and Bodotria (Fortb), the southern bound·
ary os Caledonia. Tacitus had formed a more correct notiou oi
the sbape oi Britain thau either Caesar, Strabo, or Ptolemy.

Novissimi mora. “Os the sarthest sea.”—Taae pomam. Re-
serring to the time os Agricola. Compare Dio Cassios (lxvi, 20):
Γναῖος Ἰούλιος Ἀγρικόλας πάντα κατέδραμε, καὶ πρῶτός γε Ῥωμαίων
ὧν Ζσμεν ἔγνω τοῦθ’, ὅτι ἡ Βρεττανία περίῤῥυτός tara-liicogaitas ad
id teinpus insulas, dac. Aoeording to Eusebius, Claudius had al·
ready annexed these islands to his dorninions; aud the saure is said
by Eutropius (vii, 13), Orosius (vii, 5), Bede (Hist. Aegl, i., 3),
Gildas, and others, aud certainly a report os their existence had
reached Rome by that time. Mela estimates their number at thirty,
Pliny at sorty; so that incognitas must be here equivalent to laiter
or aon pendas cognom as it is iu cicero (oie Orat, ii, 24), “ eaasaa
dieom incognitas.” Igrtotas has a situilar force iu the same writer
⁰ (de Orat, i., 39): “Ias applicationis abacorum saite et ignotam patefac·
tam atqve illustratam est.” (Compare de Orat, i., 42; Lii, xxviii..
44.)
Dispecta est et Thale, &c “Thule, also, was but just discerned
iu the distance, which snow and winter were accustomed hitherto
’ to conceal from the view.'' 'l'hule is variously identified by differ·
ent authors with Maiolaad, Nertoay, and Ieelaad. The last is the
most probabis, as the character and position os Iceland agree best
with the description ol the situation os Thule given hy Strabo aad
Pliny. Observe that the verb dispici is used when speaking oi any
thing which can not be distinguished without difficulty. The text
is doubtful in qaam batenus nia et hiems abdam We have given
the reading which makes the best sense. Some editions have Di·
speeta est et Thale quadamteaas3 oie et lisois adpetebat, “ Thule, als0,
was to some extent descricd; snow and winter were seeking to
make it their own.” Other variatious have also been proposed,
with regard to which, consult Waltlter, ad loc.

Pigrane et grave remigantibus. “ Sluggish and laboribus to row-
ers.'’ It would appear thet the first circumnavigators of Britain,
1n ordonna doubt, to enbauoe tho idea os their dangers aud hard·
ships, had represented the Northern Sea as iu so thiokened aud
halt solid a state, that the oars‘oould scarcely be worked, or the
water agitated by the winds. Tacitus, however, in what follows,
rather ebooses to explain its stagnant condition from the wantos
winus, aud the difficulty os moving so great a body os waters. But
tharaci, taken either way, is erroncous3 as this sea is never ab·
