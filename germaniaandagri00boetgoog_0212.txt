Supply colligas-Namque.. There isthe same difference between ·
rtem and namquo aa between enim and etenim, γάρ alld καὶ γάρ.
Namque may be frequently translated, as in the present passage,
“ thus, sor instance.’'

Rutilo Caledoniam habitantium coma, dcc. Compare the descrip-
tion given os the physical appearance os the Germane in the Ger·
omnm, 4.-Silumm colorati vultus. “The swarthy complexione
, os the Silures.” The Silures answer to the people os Walrs.
They occupied what are now the counties os Breclmoclr, Glemorgon,
Mmmoutl, Haeserat, and Rodnor. Some commentatore ret'er the
expression color-ati vultos to the staining of the face and body. This,

, however, was not a custom peculiar to the Silures, but common to

all the Britons, aud can not, therefore, be meant here; on the con·
trary, colorati resera to the dark complexion produced by the rays

os the sun. Thus we have the expressions, Indi comesti, Seres col· ·

orati, dcc-Tomi. “curly’' The torti crines are. what Brotier
terms “ les chroma crtpas.”

Proximi Gallis ct similer runt. ‘1‘ These nearest the Gauls resem-
ble, also, the inhabitants ol that country.” Literally‚ “ are also like
(thern).” Os these, the inhabitants of the modern Kent are most -

Seu durante originis ai, dcc. ‘⁶ Either because the influence os a
common origin still remains, or because, the lands advancing till
they lie opposite one another, climate has given this character to
their frames‚’' i. a, similarity os climate has given a similarity os
character to their frames. With habitam supply eom. Tacitus
means, that the coasts os the two countries‚ which at first run in
different directions, gradually approach one another, till at the point
where they end they lie opposite and parallel. Observe that di-
vorsa is here used in the same sense as adverso. Compare Aen,
xiil, 57; Hirr, ht, 13, &c-In uniuersum tamem (estimanti. Com·
pare Germ, 6. This use of the dative is execedingly common in
Greek. (Compare Herod, i., 14; v., 88. T'ltrtcyd, i., 10, dcc.)

Eorum sacro deprehendar, &c ‘⁶ You may discover traces os their
religious system in the firm belief (os the Britons) in certain super-
stitione.'' Observa that eorum here refers to the Gaula, the people
mentioned at the close os the previous sentence. The superstitious
ritas meant are particularly the mysterious and bloody solemnltiee
os the Druids. From the language of Tacitus it would seem to
