Oui aereis diebus, dre. “ Wbom on certain days ¹they consider it
lawful ιο propitiare with burnan victims als0.” These victims were
’ usually prisoners taken in war, and the modain which they were
sacrificed may be learned from Strabo (vii, p. 295). Germanicus
saw in the Saltus Teutobergiensis the altars on which, aller tbe
overthrow of Varus, the tribunes and principal centurione were im-
molated. (Ana, i., 61.) We find mention of human sacrifices
among the Semnones (Germ, c. 39), the Cimbri (Oros, v. lb); the

Saxones (Sidon. Apoll, Ep, viii, 6); the Heruli (Procop, ii.,'14);
