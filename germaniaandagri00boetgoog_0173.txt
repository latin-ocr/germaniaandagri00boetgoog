Quid enim aliod, dcc. “Por what else has the East, humbled
beneath a Ventidius, Pacorus himself also having been lost, to
boest of against us, save the slaughter of Crassusl” ‘Crassus was
defeated and slain by the Parthians, BC. 53. After the defeat of P.
Decidius Saxa, iieutenant of Syria, by tha Parthians, and the seiz·
ure of Syria by Pacorus, son of King Orodes, P. Ventidius Bassus,
haring been sent thither by Marc Antony‚ slew Pacoms, and com-
plbtety restored the Roman affairs. Ventidius himself, however,
was a man of very inferior ability, andos very low origin, having
been originally amula-driven and he had risen to the command of
the Roman armies in this quarter solely through the favor of An-
tony‚ whom he joined with three legions atter the battle of Mutina.
Hence the peculiar force of dejectae infre, as implying that the once
baughty empire of the Parthians had been brought so low as to be
compelled to yield to the arms of a Ventidius. (Diltbey, ed loc.)

who had joined themselves to the Cimbri. (Ces, B. G, 1., 7, 123
Vell. Petere, 11, 12)) M. Aurelius Scaurus, the same year, was de·
feated and taken prisoner hythe Cimbri, and put to death by Boi·
orix, a chief, or, as Livy styles him, a furious youth (feror yuee·
ms). He had excited the ire of the barbarians by advising them
’ not to e'nter Italy, assuring them that the Romans were invincible.

Manlius (11.0, 105), through their rasbness and dissensione, suffered

a severe defeat from the Cimbri, near Tolosa. (Iria, Ep, 67 ; Veli.

Manlio. All theold MSS. end editions bave M. quoque Manlio. Cn.

and Π, are frequently oonfounded in the MSS. ln the present in-

stance, however, the true reading is Gneo, since it bad been decreed
after the death of M. Manlius Capitolinus, who was accused by the
patrician party of aiming at royal power, that no one of this family

should bear the name of Morene. (Lis, vi, 20, Cia, Phil, i, 13.)
