sources ol the erueturne north of Bobenia. Their name is not
mentioued by Ptolemy; and es we haue nottho least hint in his-

vision of the Hermunduri dwelt on the bauks oi the Danube, in tbe
eastern part os nanneto. From a fragment ot Dio Casuum we
learn that Domitius Ahenobarbus (AD. 2) assigned them this abedo
when wandering in search of new settlements. The Turoni, on
the nortbem side of the Mein, mentioned by enemy, are probably

as belonging to them are, Δοκόριτον (lentur), Zeyddowov (Wuret-
burg), Δηούονα (Scbwmnsartl, or Detrooog), Βέργιον (Eandem, or
