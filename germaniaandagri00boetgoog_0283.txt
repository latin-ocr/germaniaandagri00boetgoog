deserted its'native soil to dwell in the foresta of Germany, where
severe cold prevailed for the greater part of the year, and where,
even in summer, impenetrable woods prevented the genial rays of
the sun from reaching the ground. They thought that the Germana
must have lived there from the beginning, and therefore called them
indigene,ornativesofthesoil. (Germa.) Moderninquiries,hovv·
ever, have traced the descent of the Germanic raca from the inhab-
itants of Asia 3 since it is now indisputably established that the Ten-
tonic dialects belong to one great family with the Latin, the Greek,
the Senserit, and the other languages of the Indo-European chain.
Von Hammer calls the Germans a BactrianoMedian natium He
makes the name Germani, or Sermoni, in its primitive impert, tohave
meant those who followed the worship of Buddha; and hence the
Germana, according tobim, are that ancient and primitive race who
came down from the mountains of Upper Asia, the cradle of the hu·
man species, and spreading themselves over the low country more
to the south, gave origin to the Persian and other early natione.
Hence the name Declermeaia applied in early times to all that tract
of country which lay to the north of the Oxus. The ,land of Ermaia,
therefore, which was situate beyond this river, and which corre-
sponds to the modern Chorarin, is made by Von Hammer the native
home of the Germanic rece, and the Germana themselves are, as
· he informs us, called burianam, their primitive name, by the Ori-
ental writers down to the fourteenth century. (Wicn Jahrb, vol
ii, p. 319. Compare vol. ix, p. 39.) Another remarkable choum·
blance is, that, besides the name referred to, that of the modern
Propriam may be found under its primitive form in the Persian
tongue. We have there the term Praeclare, or Paroreian, in the
sense of “a people.” ln Meninslri (i, p. 633), we have Baream
and Borneskon, in the sense of “communitaa ejrredem religionie‚·”
while in Ferghengi Schuuri, Perimelen, or Paroreian, more thau once
occurs (vol. i, B., 182, dvc). Even the name Sucina, or Suam
(sanans), isto be found in tlre Persian tongue under the form Saarna,
as indicating not only the last dynasty of the Persian Empire (the
, Sassanides), but also those acquainted with the doctrines of the Des-
satin, the old Persian dialect of which is sar more nearly related to
the Gothic than the modern Persian to the German. ιῙιι the Orient-
al historias, moreover, mention is made of the dynasty of the sons
of Boia, in whom we may easily recognize the progenitore of the
Boii, while traces of the name of the Gatti may be found in that of
Kal, in Chorasin. (Ferg. Sclnuri, B, 331.) Even as early as the
time of Herodotus, the name of the Γερμάνιοι appears among the an-
