OHAPTER XXIX.

Initio astatis. This is the commencement oi a new summer,
ΑΒ. 84. The expression eadem astate (chap. xxviii) shows that
Tacitus had finishcd his regular account ol Agricola's proceedings
during the previous year, and that the narrative of the adventures
of the Usipii is to be looked upon as a kind of supplement. Some
editors, however, supply septimo, which, when abbreviated into vll,
might be absorbed by the letters VlT at the close oi the last chap
ten-Neque ambitiose tulit. “ He neither endured with an ostenta·
tious drmuess,” i. a, he did not affect a stoical indifference in order

to excite the admiration os others-Rursus. “On the other hand.‘’
Observe that rursus has here the force oi contra, and consult Botri-
cher, Lex. Tac, ε. c.. p. tro-Et ia luctu, &c Observa that et has
beretha force osred. (consult Botricler, Lea. Tan, s. a, bv.. p. 178.)

Quo. ‘⁴ In order that it.‘’-Mngnum ct incertum terrorem. “An
extensive and dubious alarm,” i. a, in many and various places.-
Lcngo pore exploratos. “ Approved bya long allegiance.” By pace
is meant a peaceiul submissior to the Roman away-Ad martem
Grcmpium pervenit. In the ancient Scottish tongue this ridge was
called Grantzlain, now the Grampian Hills. lt runs from Dumbar-
tou to Aberdeenshire. In Strathern, about hals a mile south os tho
Kirk of camerinis a valley nearly a mile broad, and some miles
long, through which the Eme and Ruchel dovr. Here are the re-
mains of two Roman camps, with a double wall and trenohsone
large enough to contain the eight thousand men which Agricola led
to battle, the other smaller, and suited for the three thousand caval·
ry. Two miles southeast is a third camp, in which two legions might
be conveniently quartered. They were, perhaps, posted here by
Agricola, that be might keep upa communication with the deet.
The place itsell still bears the name of Grzlgoclmn¹ llonsmoon,N taken
from that ottho Caledonian leadern

Cruda ac viridis senectus. “A bale and vigorous old age.” Gom·
pare virgil (En, vi, 304): “ Sed crudo deo viridisque semotus.'¹
So in Greek, ὠμὸν γῆρας, and dpcyipove-Ac suc quisque &cora gea-
tcnter. “And bearing each their honorarydecorations,” i. e, tha
trophies won from enemies; not, as Ernesti thinks, the honorary re-
wards they had received sor their valon-Calgacus. The more cor-
rect sonu os the name, as restored by Ernesti and Brotier from MSS.
and early editions. The'common text has Galgacus. Becker
thinks that Calgarus is the true form, and refers in support of his
opinion to Ossianl
