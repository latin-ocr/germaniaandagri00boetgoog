merely indicates possibility, and is equivalent to obruere potuisset.
The subjunctive has not unsrequently a pregnant sense, involving
porse, velle, opas erse. The reason why Tacitus expressed himself
on this occasion so cautiopsly may probably be owing to the fact
that Frontinus was still alive. ln Hier, iv, 71; v, 21, he uses
greater hosdem-Alterius. The term alter, although it is com-
monly syhonymous with ἔτερος, sometimes stands sor ἕτερός τις, end
is even equivaleut to ἄλλος occasionally. Compare chapter¹ v.:
‘⁴ Caruilio taetreque alterius.”

Qaaatam licebat. “As sar as was permitted,'’ ι’. a, as far as was
permitted by the *times in which ho lived, when to appear eminent
was derogemus, and it was dangerous, especially for the governor
ot so important a province, even in the time of Vespasian. Fronti-
nus lived till ΑΒ, 106, and was an augur at the time of his death.
He was the authores a work upon the art os war (strategematica),
andos another upon the aqueducts os Rome, the superintendence
, os which was intrusted to him during the reigns ot Nerva aud Tra-
jan-Valr'damqee et pugnacem Silurum gentem. Since the victories
of Suetonius Paulinus, from about A.D. 62 to 75, we hear nothing
os the struggles with the Silures. But that the subjection of these
wild mountain tribes had not yet hcen accomplished, is shown not
only hy Frontinus's expedition, but by Agricola's enterprise agelnst
Mona. '

CHAPTER XVIII.

Hune Britannia statum, duc. “Found this condition os Britain,
these vicissitudes os warlike operations‚” r'. e., tound Britain in this
state, as resulting from the fluctuating fortune os the contests which
have just been mentioned. Observe that cicer here marks a result,
not what was passing at the time-Media jam estate. This was in
hu. 78.-Grem et milites, velat, dec. “ When both our own soldiers,
as is all onward morements had been given over, were addressing
themselves to enjoyments sree from care, and the enemy to the
seizure of the opportunity thus offered them.” Observe the middle
sense of verterentur, and with regard to omisso expeditione compare
the explanationes Walch: ‘⁴ als ardre lle Urberrcrlltigung der Iascl

ausgegeben.”
