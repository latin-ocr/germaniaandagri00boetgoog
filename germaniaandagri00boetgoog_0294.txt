Q.
Ἴ Qolor. The Romans first became acquainted with tuicpowerful

German tribe alter the conquestos Pannonia. They always appear
in the closest connection with the Marcomanni. Their most an·
cient settlements on the Danube reached eastward to the Tibiscus,
or Teis, where they bordered on the Getae3 but partly in conse-
quence of the irruptiouof the lazyges, partly through the influenco
oi Maroboduus, they withdrew westwardss The name Quadi was
given to the mixed tribe composed os the followers of Maroboduus
and Catualda, settled by the Romano between the Marus and the
Cusus. Toward the north they reached to the carpathico Mount·
ains, beyond which dwelt the Lygii. Their western limita cannot
be determined with accuracy. · The original tribe oi the Quadi
seems to hare extended westward beyond the Morava, and to hare
united with their brethren on the east. They carried on ware with
M. Aurelius, Commodus, Caracalla, Gallienus, Aurelian, Constan-
tius, Julian, and Valentinian l., till the unu century, when they ap· ’
pear to have¹ coalesced with other nations. (Dio Gaea, lxxi, 8,
uqq.,·1nii.,2; lxxvii, ab.) Their cities mentioned by Ptolemy
are, Φροοργισατίς, Καριδοργὶς, Μεδοσλάνιον, Ῥοὸὀδοννον, Φιληκία,
Μελιὸδαονσν, the sites oi which can not-be determined with any
accuraey, Ἀνόονέτιον (Dioezcg), Κσλμαντία (Szomolyon), 'Avcbcv

Rarir appears properly to have comprehended the whole coun-

to have included Vindelicis. Dio Cassius (liv, 22), in his account
