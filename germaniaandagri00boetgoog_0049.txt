xlvi ou run sruun or raorros.

= b. Words which are commonly called sroorrtrous, but which, io
truth, are of such a nature that the one augmento, explains, and am· '
plilies with a new sense the signification of the other. Generully,

substantivas, of which Tacitus is very fond, are constructed in this
manner: sedt'tio et turbe, fulgor et claritudo, dolor et ira, odiam et itt-
ordt'a, modestia et pudor, sanguis et cede, vires el robor. Veteres et
sem, antiqui ac conss, do not so much belong to this head, as they
do not express the same things. of adjectives, adverbs, and verbs so
used, the number is less. The following are exemplos: incertumst Δ
ambiguam, immotum fixamque, turbide et seditiose, umere arsenoite,
occrdtcre et abdce, pollui sedarique.

c. The figure called in Greek ἓν διὰ δυοῖν (Hendiadys), ol which
we have an example in the well-known passage, patetis libamus et
coro. But the examples ol this figure which are found in Tacitus
(and they are very many) prove that there is a greater power in sub-
stantivas and adjectives. constructed after this manner, thau iu the
usual fo'rm ol speech: Aga, 16, nec allam in barbada sartio genas
omisit ira et victoria (ihis has greater force than ira masau it is
anger and the licenss of victory, rather than ol the conquerors);

y Germ. , 33, super sexaginta milia-oblectationi oculisque occidental (not

simply obkctctiom' carloman, but lor our entertainmentaud themate
pleesure of the spectacle). 'l'he copulative conjunctiora osten serves s
for an explanation: Ausul, i.. 40, incedebat muliebre et mobile
agmen (not miseram mulierum agmen, but a troop consisting of
women, and lor that reason chiefly miserable). Α

d. As to the examples of Purooasrr, they proceeded less fiam the
genius cf Tacitus than lrorn the common usage of the Latin laugusge,
nor do they detract in any measure from the brevity ol the dheonrse3

since ncne of the old writers has giren offence by thora as it were, ⁴

expressing things abundantly. But there are also many among these
passages of such a kind that the one word adds something to the
meaning ol the other. Thus, mare Oceanum is spoken ol just as
Rimas amator corpru in all writers (connary to the usage ol our
language) is used pleonastically in such passages, emporis morbus,
corporum valea, libera corpora (liberi homines): astte providae, aare
predicere are also used in the older writerst ipse solur, Germ, 38,
and Diat, 5, and solas et anas, Dtat, 34, are explained by referring
’ to the Greek αὐτὸς μόνος, and also to that passage of cicero, Vm, i.
2 (qaod ipsis solis autb esset).
