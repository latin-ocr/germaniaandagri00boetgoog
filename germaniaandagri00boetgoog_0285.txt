qrhon of Lampsacus, Sotacus, Nicias, Xenocrates, Mithradates, aud
especially Pytheas of Massilia, who, in the year Be. aab, sailed to
Thule, and thence into the Baltic. (Strui, i„ 43 ii, ³, 4 3· iii, 23
iv, 4, 5. Plio, iv, 16, οι 27, 3⁰3 xxxvii, 2, or 11.) The knowl-
edge which the Romans possessed of Germany and the western
parts of Europe was derived principaily from the expeditioris of
Caesar, Drusus Germanicus, Germanicus, and Ahenobarbus. Dru-
sus Germanicus, the brother of Tiberius, made four expeditione into
Germany, and dug the canai between the Rhine oud the Chisala
(Yssel). Hs was the first who navigated the German Ossan, but
did not advanos further than the mouth of the Amisia (Eme), in the
territory of the Cauci Germanicusfthe son of Drusus (AD. li-

’ ld), made four expeditioris into Germa‘ny‚ and advaneed still further3

he was shipwreoked on the territory of tho Frisii (Ana, i., dil-52,
sii-59, sti-71 3 ii, d-td, 41-46). L. Domitius Ahenobarbus crossed
the Elbe, and penetrated further into Germany than any of his pred·
ecessors. (Ana, i, 633 iv, 44. Suet, Ner, in) Tiberius ad·
vanced to the Aratio Sea (Ano, ii, 26, 473 xii, 39. Dio, lv, d,8,

This expedition of Tiberius, however, Strabo (vii, 1, p. 291) and
Tacitus himself (c. 34) attribute to Drusus Germanicus. On the
south side of Germany the Romans made no conquesta beyond the
Danube3 but they obtained some geographiae} knowledge through
the journeys of the tradere who procured amber from the shores of
the Baltio, and from their wars with the Daci, Marcomanni, and
other tribes on this frontier. Strabo wrote in the age cf Tiberius,
when the Romans possessed a more accurate knowledge of Germauy
than at any other time, through the expeditioris of which we have
just spoken. Alter this period the Romans were almost entirely
shut out of Germany. Strabo, however, is exceedingly careless.
He did not read even Cesar's Gallio war with sufficient attentionto
understand it, and confusos almost every thing which he extracta
from the accounts brought home by Pytheas. Our difficulties are,
moreover, inereassd by the inaccuracy of the text. Pomponius
Mela is worth nothing. Pliny, likewise, was very careless, as we
ses, even in what he says of ltaly; we can not, therefore, look for
much accuracy in his account of Gennany. His work is principat
ly valuable for the proper names. The imperfect character of the
geographical knowledge which Tacitus possessed of Germany 'm
manifest from his work upon the subject. Ptolemy has ventured
to give a map of Germany, and to lay down the latitudes and longi·
tudes of a number of towns and mouths of rivers. The greater part
