- Gnoses delli et necessitatem matram. ‘¹ The causes of the war, and
our present necessity,” i. a, the motives that necessarily impel us
to war-Nam et universi sanitatis expertes. ‘⁴ For wa are both, all

samus after repastinandi compare Annibal peto parem (Iria, xxx,

atque omno. By no means synonymous merely, as some suppose.
Proeliom marks here the beginning of the condiet, and omre vthe
maintaining of it gallantly by arms and prowm-Spem aa subsidium
aa nornis monibus mebant “ Had their hope and last resource in
our prowess.” In ordinary prose the sentence would have run as
