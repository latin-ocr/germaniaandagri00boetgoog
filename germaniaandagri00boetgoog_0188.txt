“ To grean over fields, ιο labor upon dwellings,” ι’. a.. to groan over
the plough, ιο labor in the erection of dwellings. The verb illabo-
rare is here formed atter the model of ingemere. lt nowhere else
appears in this meaning, since illaboratae, which does occur, has
the signification of “not labored,” “done without lahor.”-Saas

adimasque satanae, dic. “To keep their own fortunas and those
of others in a state of constant disqniet through mingled hope and
fear,’' i. a, to be harassed hythe alternate hopes aad fears of en·
riching or ruining themselves and others in trade and traffic. ’

Secari assasse ιοοιιοιὲ. “ Without care and auxiety as regards
meu.‘’ Observe that aarum, in this and the following clause, must
. not be rendered “ safe.” Compare Agris, 9: “ Castrensis jurisdic-
tio occurset obtusior,” dre, and ιιοοιόι securus” (Horat, Od, i, xxvi„
*at-Ut ldis aa voto quidem optas esset. “ That they would not need
even a wish.” Rhenanus conjectured optas sit for opas aare, and
his emendation was adopted by all subsequent editors until the time
of Ernesti, who restored meat, without, however, ass'gning a very
satisfactory reason, The true reason is this: Tacitus does not
mean to say that they dora no need even of a wish, as if statinga
fact; buthe gives merely the result of his own reflections, namely,
that they would aot need even a wish, il there were any thing ιο be
actually wished for. Compare the explanation of Walther: “dm

(scilicet si quid esset optandum).”

Hellusios ιι Oxionas. Probably the inhabdants of Lapland. Tbe
fsble here stated may possibly have arisen from their wearing the
skins of wild heusta-Oxionas. Tacitus oceasionally uses this
Greek ending, as in Hetaeconcs (chanadii), Sciam (chap. xlv.) ;
Vangionas cc Nemetas (Aac, xii, ary-ln medium relinquam. “I
will make asubject of doubt, and leave undecided.” Equivalent, ’
as Botticher correctly remarks, to in dumam οοοοιοιο relinquam ia “
medio. The preposition in, though joined here with the accusative,
includes at the same time tbe idea of the ablativa, and the clause
may, therefore, beranked under the head of a syllepsis. (Consult
