of Germanicus, and granddaughter of Agrippa, was born in this
place. It is probahis, therefore, that the colony was originally
founded by Agrippa, and was' called Colonia Agrippina merely, until
Agrippina, atter her uuion with Claudius, sent out her own colony,
· uf which Tacitus elsewhere makes mention (Aac, xii, 27), and the
object of which, in all likelihood, was to strengthen the first. The
name Colonia Agrippinensis began atter this, it would seem, to be
employedincommoriwiththeother. (ComparePlin, Η, N.,iv.‚ 17.)

1111111. The Batavi were the inhabitants of South Holland and

some adjacent parts. They occupied the district between the Va-
· halis (what) and Moselllfeose), above their junction; and also the
island formed by the northern arm of theRhine (orRhine of Leyden),
· “ the Vahalis end Mosa after their junction, and the ocean, which
island now constitutos part of South Holland. They seem, also,
from tha language of the text, to have occupied asmall tract on the
beaks of the Rhiuc, not included in the incola Batavorum, as it is
' called by Cesar (B. G, iv., 10). Compare, on this hole subject,
tha account given by Tacitus (Hier, iv, 12), aud asmsseograuieal
Index.

Ripa. When n‘pa is used alone, iu speaking of the Rhiuc, it
generally means, as in the present instance, the* left bank of tha
stream-Seruiana donurtiea. Compare Hier, iv, 12. The time
when this happened is not given. Caesar found them already es-
tablished in their new scats-In quibus pore Ronmni imperii fierent.
This marks, of course, the consequence, not the intent.
