“Carus Ooaanrrus Tscrrus was probably born in the reign of
Nero, but neither the place oi his birth, nor the exact date,is known,
nor is any thing ascertained of his parentage. There is no reason for
supposiug that he belonged to the illustrious patrician gens of the
Cornelii, nor any evidence of bis having been born at Interamna, in
Umbria (the modern Terei), as is sometimes stated. The few facts
of his lise a're chiefly collected from his own works, and from the
lettera oi hia friend, the younger Pliny. Tacitus was about the same
age as Pliny, but the elder of the two. Pliny was born about AD.
61, in the reign os Nero, which commenced AD. 54. A passage oi
the elder Pliny (H. N, vii, 16) speaks of a son os Cornelius Tacitus,
the procurator of the emperor in Belgio Gaul. Lipsius concludes that
this Cornelius Tacitus was the historiam but as Pliny died in A.D. ,
79, it seems hardly probable that the passage can apply to him. It‘
bas been conjectured that the procurator was the father of the historian.

“Tacitus states that he owed his first promotion to Vespasiau, and
that he was indebted for other farors to his successore, 'litus aad
Domitian (Hira, i., 1). Iu the year AD. 77, C. Julius Agricola, then
consul, betrothed to him his daughter; and the marriage took place
aster Agricola’s'consulship. Tacitus does not state what places he
filled under Vespasian and Titus, but iu the reign of Domitian he iu·
forms us ὦ) he assisted as one of the Quindecimriri, at the celebra· ἱ
tion of the Ludi Saeculares, which event took place in the fonrteenth ·

' consulship os Domitian (AD. 88). At that time hewaaalso praetor

(Aac, xi, 11). He was not at Rome when his father-inlaw, Agricola,
died there (AD. 93), in the reign os Domitiam but it is too much to
affirm, aa some have done, that he was an exile during the time‘of
this emperor. It has already been shown that he was at Rome in
AD. 88. Α passagsin his Life os Agricola (c. 45) rather leads to
the inference that he was at Rome during many of the atrocities
which Domitian perpetuated aller the 'death of Agricola, though ho
had been absent from Rome for four years prior to Agricola’s death.
