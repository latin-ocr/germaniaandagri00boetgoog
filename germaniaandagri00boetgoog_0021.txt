work of Tacitus. It has been sometimes doubted if it is by Tacitus,
but the style is in favor of the common opinion, though it presente in
many respects a marked contrast to the ‘Annal's,’ the work of his
mature years. Messala, one of the speakers, attributes the decline
of oratory tc the neglectos the arduons methodos study adopted by
the older oratore, who learned their art by attaching themselves to
some eminent speaker, 'and by experience in the actual business of
life: in Messala's time, the school of the rhetoricians was the only
place of discipline for the young. But Maternus, another speaker,
indicates more truly the causes of tlre decline of eloquence, ny a res·
erence to the politica] condition cf the Romans, and the suppression
ol their energies under the empire, as compared with the turbulent
activity of the Republican period.

“ The ‘Annals’ of Tacitus are the work oi his riper age, on which
bis historica] reputation mainly rests. Though entitled Annals, and
111 general sufficientIy true to the chronological order of avenn, the
title of Annalscouveys no exact notion oi the character of this work.
‘The writer moulded the matter of his history, and adopted it to his
purpose, which was not a complete enumeration oi the domestic and
foreign events of the period, but a selection oi such as pertrayed in ·

with the notion os the govemment osone man. The power that had
been founded and consolidated by Augustus had been transmitted
through many princes, few of whom had distinguished themselves
by ability, and some had sullied the purple with the most abominable
crimes. Yet the imperial power was never shaken after it was once
firmly established, and the restoration oi theold Republic was never
seriously contemplated by any sober thinker. The necessity ol the
imperial power was felt, and the historian, white he describes the
vices and inhies oi those who had held it, and often casts a glauce
os regret toward tha Republican period, never betrays a suspicion ⁹
that this power could be replaced by any other, in the abject and
fallen state of the Roman people. Itis this conviction which gives
to the historical writings oi Tacitus that dramatis character which
pervadas the whole, and is seen in the selection of events, and the
mode in which they are presented to the render. It is consistent
with this that the bare facts, as they may be extracted from his nar·
native, are true, and that the colorirrg with which he has heightened
thern may often be false. This coloring was his mode of viewing
the progrcss oi events, and the development of the imperial power:
