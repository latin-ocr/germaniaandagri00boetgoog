Agitasse 0. Cesaram de intranda Britannia, dac. “ That Caius
Caesar had meditated the design os inuading Britain is quite certain ;
(and he would have donc so) had henot been precipitato in forming
schemes, fickle in changing his mind, and had not his mighty at·
tempas against Germany proved fruitless.'' (consult Suet, Caliga,
46; Dio Gaas, lix, 25.) This expedition was undertaken not from
Gaul, but from the Batavian shores. The light-house, which Ga·
ligula built, was at the second mouth os the Rhine, now choked

Togodumnus‚ appeared in the field against Plautius and Vespasian;
and, atter the capture os Camaloduuum, the war was considered as
completed; it appears probahle that most of the tribes south os the

pedition laid the foundation os Vespasian's subsequent elevation to
