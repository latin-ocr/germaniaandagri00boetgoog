Suionum. The Suiones inhabited the south of Sweden‚ which
was supposed by the aucieuts to be an island-Ipso in oceano. ‘¹ In
the very ocean.” The reference is to their supposed insular situa-
tion. The ocean meantisthe Baltic Sca-Eo differt. “Differsin

· this respect from that of ours.'’-and utrimque prora dcc. Resem·
” bling the cannes still used hy the Swedes, and hy our own aborigi-
nes. (Compare Ano, ii.,6.)-Pnrotumsemperappulsui, duc. “As-
sords a front always ready for driving up on the ronchu-Nec min·
intraretur. “They are neither worked.'‘-In ordinem. “In any
regular order.'’ Observe the employment of io with the accusative, “
ou account of the idea of movement implied in adjungunt—Solu·
tum, at in quibasdam fluminum, dac. “'I'heirhrodt't os rowiug is
without any regularity, as (is practiced) ‘rn some rivers, and changes,
. as occasion requires, on this side or on that.” The movement
here described is like the paddlingof a canoa-In quibosdmflomi·
num. Pronouns, adjectives, and participles in the plural, joined
witha genitive, are of frequent occurrence in Tacitus. ¹

Est apud illos et ophar Ιιοηοε. The wealth here referred to was
acquired by traffic. What Tacitus here states relative to their
honoring wealth is directly the reverse of what was the case with
the other Germane. Of these last our author remarks (chap. v.):
“ Posses-sione et acu hund perinde afficiantur,” dac-Nullis jorn ea·
captionibus. ,The particle jam here implico, that as we go further
northward the pcople degenc'rate more and more from the spirit of
liberty which characterined the southern tribes, till at last we come
to a people with au absolute roien-Non premo jore paradi.
⁴¹ With no precarious conditions of allegiance.'' More freely, “with
an absolute claim upon their obedience.” Pretorium jas is a right
granted to a person’s entreaties. Some editors take parendi iu a
passive sense, and adduce, as parallel instanccs, censendi cansa (cic,
Vm, i., ls); celandi (ruet, i., 9, 2³). But this is unnecessary.

Nec crota in promotae. “Nor are arms (allowed to be kept) pro·
miscuously.” supply amara runt-Et quidem seron. “And he,
too, a slave.”-Oeeanas. Their supposed insular situation—Oriona
porro armatorum memo, dte. As in the case of the Pretorian sol-
diers and the Janisseriee. Some editors give uticam but the cou-

l struction of a singular noun of multitude with a plural ¹yerh is only
allowable when some clause intervenes and separatcs thern Such
a phrase as turbu ruunt would he inadmissible.-Enirarcro .....
