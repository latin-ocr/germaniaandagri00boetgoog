kept over them, to preserve them from corruption3 whereas septo
means that their own modesty was a sufficient ,desence against all
attempta upon their honor, which agrees much better with the gen·
eral sense ol the description. (Compare Diltley, cd hep-Nullis
spectaculorum illecebris, dcc. ‘⁴ Corrupted by no allurements os pub-
lic spectacles, by no incitamenta cs convivial entertainments.'’ On
the corrupting influence of the Roman gemes and entertainments,¹
consult Seneca, Epist, vii, ar; Juvenal, Sat, i., 55, seqq.,· Ia, xi,
' 162, 201, 202.

Litercrum secretu. “clandestine correspondence in writing.'’
For an account cs the various explanations given to this phrase by
different editors, consult Diltlcy, orl loc. The meaning which we
have adopted appears the most satisfactory—Paccianae irc lom aro
merbec gente adulteria. On the frequency os this crime at Rome
under the emperors, consult Aac, ii, 85; Juvenal, vi, 48& Il, ix,
zh-Qccrrrmpoerrcproeeerrc One oi the MSS. has parentibus in place
os precem, a very improbable reading. Even at Rome, before the
passage of the Lex Julia, the husband might, if he pleased, inflict
punishment on an unlaitbsul wife. (Dirc. Hal, ii, p. 95; Suet,
Tic, 35.)

decisis crinibus. “With her hair cut short.'’ Cutting off the
hair was regarded as a most disgraceful punishment. (consult
Du Gange, Glose, e. c. Decalrotic.) In Luitprand's Laws citha
Langobardi (ii, 17) we find it ordered, “ clalterm decalvari el sasti-
gcri per circe emicantes ipsias loci.”-Per emnem ciram. Equivalent
to per lotum cirum-Publicola enim pudicitie, dcc. ‘⁴ For no indul-
gence is shown to open prostitution: such an offender will not find

ahusband by beauty, nor by youth, nor by riches.” Literally, “ to
prostituted modesty,'’ publicola being here equivalent to calgala.
Lipsius suggests etiam in place oi enim, ou the ground that Tacitus
refers now not to the adulterous females just spoken os, but to un·
wedded ones. This is all very true, and yet he entirely mistakes
the meaning os the writer. The latter is merely assigning arenson
sor the severe punishment os adultery among the Germans; and
this is because no indulgence is shown toa prostituto. Forhe who
would spum the idea cf wedding a prostituto would certainly not
tolerate aprostitute in wedlock. (Wclller, cd loc.)

Nemo enlm illicacta ridet, dcc. Α bitter allusion to the contrast
