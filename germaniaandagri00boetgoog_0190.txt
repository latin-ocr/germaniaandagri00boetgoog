Tne composition oi this work may be assigned, from intercal end
, external evidence, to the year os Rome Sto-l (nl). es-et), four

years alter Agricola’s death. The first three chapters comprise the ·

preiaee, the substance of which is as follows: In times oi yore,
when there was no reason, as noW, ιο dread men’s ignorance of vir·
tue, and their envy oi her votaries, it was usual to hand down ιο

posterity the exploits and characters of famous men, and c man ,

was not found fault with even is hc narreted his own lise. But in
times like these, when we have only lately seen that to praise il·
lustrious men was a capital crime, Ι must plead sor savor and in·
dulgence, which Ι should not have donc had not my path lain
through times inimical to virtue, in which even those remain un·
punished through whose charges Agricola reihand through whose
means many have been calumniated. At length, however, spirit
and liberty cre returning, though the desire ol writing springs up
but gradually and slowly, since talenta and cccl may be more
qniclily smothered end suppresscd than rouscd again to vigor and
activity; and sloth, at first the object oi cur hatred, ends with in-
gratiating itseli inte our favor. Hence 1 am led ιο hope that 1
shall meet with excuse ior having formed the design cf writing thia s
memorr.
