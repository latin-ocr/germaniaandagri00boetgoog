which separated Italy from Raetia, and which extended from tha
St. Gothord, whose numerous peaks bore the. name of Adule, to
Mount Brenner, in the Tyrol. The Lepontine Alps, which commence
immediately west of the Raetian, form in one sense a part of them,

Anum. A German tribe, the earliest record of whom we find in
Tacitus (Germ, c. 40). But this author only mentions their name,
states a few particulare relative tc their religion, and intimatas that
they were a branch of the Suari. He appears to have known very “
-little about them. They are not mentioned in the expeditione of
Drusus and Tiberius, and, therefore, probably, were at that time on
the east of the Elbe. Ptolemy places them on the wastin what is
now Mogdebarg. D'Anville basin his map assigned to them tha
same district which they occupied in the fifth century, before their
emigraticn to England, and parts of which the modern Angles still
cccupy. He allots to thern the greatest portion of modern Scbloewig,
and some part of Holstein, making the German Ocean their western
boundary, tha Saxone their nearest neighbors on the south, the Va·
rini cn the soutbeast‚ and the J utes on the north. lt is impossible
to fix with accuracy any boundaries for the Angli from the account
given by Tacitus ; but his statement appears perfectly reconcilable
with D'Anville's map and the Saxon Chronicle. About the middle
of the titlh century (449) a large body of Saxone and Angles‚ led by
chgist and Harsa, sailed over to England, and established perma-
nent settlements in the island. The Angles‚ however, seem to bave
prevailed in numbers or influence, for it was they that gave the
name to their new country, Aegei-land, Anglia (England), though it
was sometimes called Saxonis Transmarina. The name Anglo-
Saxonsg which comprises both Angles and Saxona, was invented by
later historiens for the sake of convenience. (Penny Cyclopa, vol.

Ancarviair. A German tribe dwelling on the east of tbe Visur-
gis, or Weser, between the cauci and Cherusci, and extending over
apartof Lanebcrg and Golacberg to the Steiaduder Sec, which formed
tha boundary between them and the Cherusci, and on both sides of
tbeRiverAller. Tha Lethe seemsto have formed thairsoutheastern
boundary. On the nortbeast they reached to the neighbcrbood of
the Elbe. It appears that they dwelt‚ also, on the west of the tt-
surgis (Aaa, ii., 8). Traces of their name are still found near the
Erue, in Aegean, Engern, Eagerahnuaen, Angcrmitnde, dic. (Gom-
pareMannert,vol.iii.,p.278, seqq.) . . . .c. 3284
