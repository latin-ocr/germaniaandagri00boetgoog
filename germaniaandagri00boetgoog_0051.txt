raded with a kind of horror as at the sight of a Laocoon attempting
in vain to burst tho frigbtful knots of serpente? , Surely it is a desigu
wer-thy of the dignity of the Roman Empire‚ to expeud all the re·
sources of so profound a skill in setting forth what was the fate and
what the chauces of events, through which the power of a “people,
¹ now for a long time most mighty, destroyed itself;” what were the
, vices both of citizens and rulers, which provoked the rengeauce aud
punishment ofthe immortal gods, so that that mighty imperial strue
ture began to fall to ruia. Behold s second Scipio, not sittipg among
the ruins of proud Carthago when she had just tirlfilled her destiny,
but on the soil of Rome herself, even now siuking to destruction, aud
prophesyiug with gushiug tears the ruin of his country! See him
meditatiug, not with a sacfiuons and far-fetched effert, but nuder
aspects which to such a mind present themselves spontaneonsly, upon
the image of his country, before so excellent and so perfect iu all its
parts, now distorted aud ruiued! And we see that he practiced no
less art than Sophocles used in his divine tragedias, in arranging
every several part, aud assigniug its own place to each. After pre-

fixing, both to the historias and tc the books of annale, a prologus, iu ·

which not ouly the argument of the whole work, but its entire plan
and character, are hriefly shadowed forth, he then leads the minds
of bis readers, now with a quickened, and now with a slackened and
restrained pace, through all the stages of the action, which are meted
out in a manner fit aud suitable to the things themselves and to the
laws of artt and he so depicta the natures and charactersof men, and
of the actions performed by them3 he so portrays real life, even in
its most samad and troubled forms-whether he writes of battles eud
the sturming of sities, or whether· of things done iu the palaces of
princes, and the houses of private men-that all these things we seem
to behold with o'nr own eyes, and to be present 'at them omselves.
But these are matters of such akind that their natare can be less easily
described than conceived in the miud iteelf. We shall proceed to
