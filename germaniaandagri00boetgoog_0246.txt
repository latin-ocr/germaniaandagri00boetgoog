Gyrop, i, 3: Mupdv γὰρ τὸ κρατεῖν βουλομένους τὰ τυφλὰ τοῦ σῶμα·

Constitieset. “ Stood in array (against you).'’-Nuue. “As it is,
however,'‘ i. e, as matters, however, actually are-Furto noctis.
“Under the stcalthy coveriug ol the night.”-Clumore. “Bya
merc shout.”-Ii ueteranum Britannorum fugacissimi. “ These, iu
respectos the rest of the Britons the greatest fugitives ol all.” Ob·
serve here the peculiar and apparently illogical construction of eete-
rorum with the superlative, and which we have endeavored to solt·
en down in translating. It is, in sact, an imitation oi a Greek idiom.
Thus, we have in Thucydides (i, 1), Ἀξιολογὼτοτον τῶν προγεγεοη·
μένων πολέμων. (consult Puppe, ud loe, and Herm, ud Vtg, p. 718.)

Quomodo silaus saltusque penetrantibus, &c “ As, when hunters
penetrate into woods and thiekets, each dercest animal is laid low
ογ the strength, the timorous aad weak ones are putto flight hythe
very noise os the band, so,” dm. The old reading was ruere, for
which one ol the MSS. gives curura ruere, the word contre having
been written over the line by the copyist, evidently lor the purpose,
as Walch remarks, ol imparting some sense ts ruere. This latter
reading is adopted by Brotier‚ the Bipont editor, Oberlin, Dronke,
Bekker, and others; bnt the true lection, nevenheless, is robore,
which the very opposition to eene plainly indicates. Besides, the
infinitiva ruere can not be used in this way alter quomodo or sieut3
while if we regard it, not as the infinitiva, but thetid pl. os the per-
teot (sor rueram), we ought then to have the same tense, instead
os the present, in pelluntur. ‚According to the reading which we
have adopted, both robore (i. e., egmims) and ipso sono are construct-
ed with pelluntur, but thereis a zeugma iu the passaguerra with
robore we must, in fact, understand such a verb acceditur. (Com-
pare Walch, ud loe.)

Reliquus est nunurur, bec. “There remains only a number of
cowardly and timid men, whom you have souud at last, not because χ
they opposed you, but because, being the last, they have been over-
taken aud caught by you.’' The expression quos quod tundam iu·
venietis uon restiterunt is an imitationes the Greek idiom, for qui,
quod inuenietis eos, nou restiterunt. So “Urbem quum statuo uestra

ab (vag, mn, a, ers), anu «nennium qum uersu qus turta
