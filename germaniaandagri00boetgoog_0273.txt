Batavorum now heyden The chief towns of the 'Batavi vvere Bo·
mondoum, asterward called Noviomtgus, now Nymegen or Nicone-
ger,- Arenecum, now Arnbeim ,· and TraiectumnowUtrccbt. The
name Batavi is preserved in that os Betcwe, the namo oi the distrim
included between the Rhine os Leyden, the Weal, and the Lek. “
Alter the death oi Galba, when the army on the Rhine followed Vi-
tellius to Romo, Claudius Civilia ronsed the Batavi to a revolt, which
was shortly ailerward suppressed. ’ They were employed by Agric-
ola in his wars iu Britain (Agric, 36). The changes which have
tehen place in tho leod in this quarter render tho geography eome-
what difficult. Io tha time os Tacitae, most of the Zuyder Zce was
dry land. The rivers, especially the Rhine, have very much altered

was their original country is uncertain: is the former, it would seem
that they accompanied the first Gallie migration mentioned by Livy
and othere, and followed Segovesus into Germany, scttling in Bo·

setin westward, and that Bohernia has retained its namo to this
day, seem to point to ‘Germany as their original home. From Bo·
hernia they were expelled by the Marcomanni, end settled in Nori·
eum and Bavaria, where Boiodurum (innotuit) took its nome from
thern. At some period or other, but when is uncertain, they crossed
the Alps, and established themselves in Italy, between the Tanis,
the Silarus, ond the Apennines. They were subdued by tho Ro-
mans under Scipio Nasica, and afterward removed to the banks of
the Drcec. Aster this they were almost subdued in wore with the
Getre, end an extensive tract in this part was called Deserto Boio-
rum (Ptin, iii, 245¹ Some nithe Boii accompaniod Brennus in his
invasion of Greece, and joined thot pert oi his ermy which passed
into Asia Minor, and settled in the country called from thern Galo·
tia, where one os the three divisione oi the people bore the uerno

migrnted into Gaui, and were allowed by Cesar to settle among
theAEdui. (See Pion, iii, 2⁰, 215 iu, 32. Polyb.,i.,1⁷; imo.)
