these ternas those veterane who, since the time of Augustus, aiter
serving sixteen campaigns, were released from their military oath,
but were retained till their complete discharge under a dag (vexillum)
by themselves, free from all other military duties, except to render
assistance in the more severe battles, tc guard the, frontiers of the
surpite, and keep in subjection provinces that had been newly con·
quered, and were, therefore, more disposed to revolt. There were

· meritorii attached to each legion, and it would appear (Aoo, iii, 21)

that they amounted in number to five hundred. When there was
any necessity, they were detacbed from their legions, and some-
times, as in the present instance, were all united into one body.
Consult Walch's elaborate note on this subject.

In aquom. “Into the plain.'’-Erctitcoicm. “Led his force m
battle array up toward the mountains.’' Compare Dronke, “ Eri·

“Indc, obt satis subisse rotor cst, erigit totam ociem.”-Inatandum
some. “Thai renown must be followed up.”—Ceosioseat. For
praeconarent. So χωρεῖν, for προχωρεῖν, iu Herodotus (v, ibt-Cu-
jus posessione revocatum. Observe the omission of the preposition
a, and compare Germ, 14: “ Exiguryt liberalitate principis.‘’

Ut in dubiis comitiis. “As in the case of plaus, the issue of -
which is doubtful.’' The meaning appears to be, that Agricola had ·
had some intentiones invading Mona previous to his campaign

against tbe Ordovices; but, as the result of that campaign was
doubtful, he had not provided vessels3 and he had not had time to
do so after the conquest of tho Ordovices, when he had fully de· ,
termined to invade the island. Examples of the passive meaning
of dubim frequently occur. Thus, Soet, Aug, 17: “ M. Antonii oc
wetwem semper dottam et incertam abrupit tandem.”-Ratio et constan-
tio ducis transvexit. “The ability and resolution of the general
transported his forces across.”

Leotiasimos auctarium. Virdung supposes these auxiliarios to
have been Germane, especially Batavians, aud refers, in support of
his opinion, to Hor, v., 14, where the Germans are spoken of as
“fluminibne suetos,'' and to Molo, iii, 3, doc. But others, with more
probability, think that they were Britons', since the Batavians could
not be acquainted with the shallows between Britain and Mona.

r Eighteen years before, Suetonius Paulinus had sent his cavalry

across the straits in the same way. (Ano, xiv, sss-Quibus nota
sodo, doc. “Το whom the fords were known, and the practice of
swimming was the peculiar one of their.couutry.” Compare, as
regards the force of portos hers, the remarks of Boettcher, Lea.
