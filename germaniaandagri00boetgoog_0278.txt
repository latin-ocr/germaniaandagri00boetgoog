Grnnnr. The accounts of the ancients respecting the seats of the
Cimbri, or Cimmerii, abeund in uncertainties and contradictione.
Strabo places them on the ocean, by the Elbe3 Mela, in the islands
of the Baltic; Pliny, to the east of the Elbe, and on the peninsula
,which took its name from them, Tacitus places thern in tho sorno
quartem Ptolemy, at the extremity of the Cimbric Chersoneso.
Bnt, upon examination it does not appear that they ever inhabited
these parts. The Greeks first became acquainted with them on tho
northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus. They were driven fr‘om ol·
quanter, and disappeared from the knowledge of the Greeks, who
labled that they dwelt on the shores of the Northern Oceania a
land shrouded in perpetual night. Pytheas, who circumnavigated
the greater part of the northwest of Europe, saw alarge peninsula,
where the long nights and intense cold in winter· seemed to accord
with the poetica! descriptione of the land of the cimmerii, and so

y assigned this countryastbeir abode. In this he was followedby

most of the ancient geographers: Strabo sets thern down asom
of the tribes with which they were best acquainted; although in the
next sentence he acknowledges that all beyond the Elbe was totally
unknown to the Greeks (vii, p. ml, Ed. ons, 294). No mention
is made of the Cimbri in the expeditione of Drusus and Germani-
cus; and though the lieet of the latter discovered the cimbrio Cher·
sonese of Pytheas, they found no cimbrians dwelling in it, nor did
it bear a name derived from that people. Ptolemy places them at
the extremity of it, merely to fill up a gap, as ho has no other tribe
todx inxthislooality. Their real country lay, probably, on the north·
east side of Germany: it was on this side that they invaded Ger·
many, and were opposed by the Boii, at that time the inhabitants of
Bohemin. Boion( τὸν Ἑρκύνιον δρυμὸν οἰκεῖν. ΤοὺςδὶΚίμόρους lp

the Teutones they entered Gaul, where they vvere joined by tho
Ambrones. With their combined forces they then invaded Spain,
but were repulsed bytho Celtiberi. The Teutones and Ambrones
then made an inuption into Italy, where they were defeated by Ma·
rius (ΒΟ. 102). A part nithe cimbri} who had gone intollelvetia', ,
werenhere joined by the Tigurini; these made another attach upon
