-Admirotioac gramm “They take the lead by reason of the ad-
miration which the inspire.”-An2'nmdaertere. ‘⁴ To put ιο deatb.”
This verb commozffy means “to punisb” simply; here, however,
it isto be taken iu a stronger sense, as in Hiar, i, 46, and iv, 49,
and we may supply gladio or something similar. Tacitus, it will
be perceived, is descending from heavier to lighter punishments.-
Viacire. Bonds would be something yet more offensive to freemen
thau stupes-fiiri sacerdotibus permissam. The statement of Tac·
itus is at variance with that of Cesar, who remarks (B. G, vi, 23),
“ Quam bellom civito! aut illatum defendit, outiasert, magistratus, qui
ei bello prosint, at vita necisque hobeoatpotestotem deliguntur.'' Lip-
sius seeks to reconcile these two authorities by supposiug that
Tacitus refers to astate ofpeace, but Cesar to one of war. He is
plainly contradicted, however, by what follows.

Non quast in penam, &c What was thus inflicted by the priests
was not regarded in the light of amere judicial sentence, nor as
emanatiug from the doc, or military leader, but as something coming
from on high-Sed velot deo imperante, hc. The god Thor, the
German Mars, is meant. (Compare chapter ix.)

Effigieoqoe er signa quadam, &c ⁴⁶ (On this account), moreover,
they carry to battle effigies (of animale), aad certain standards taken
down from their (sacred) groves,” i. e, in consequence of this belief
that the god is present in the battle-field, they bear ιο battle the
effigies of animals answering the purposes of standards, which, from
“ ιὶιοόἰτοοωειοοοο of their havin'g been preserved in sacred groves,
will, it is conceived, propitiate the favor os the divinity, aud induce
him to be on their side. With effigies, supply feroram, an ellipsis
supplied elsewhere by Tacitus himself, Hirr, iv, 22: ‘¹ Dcpromta
silvis locisque serarum imagines.‘’ The expression effigies et signa
’ qaedam, moreovsr‚ means nothing more than ‘⁴ effigies forming or
answering the purpose of a kind of standards,” the conjunctiora et
being here merely explanatory, and the standards referred to being
like those represented on the columns of Trajan aud Antoninus,
namely, the figure of an animal at the top of a pole. (Dilthey, ad
loc-Gerlach, od loc.-Klemm, Germ. Altertbamek, p. 2³1.)

Among the Romans a torono contained thirty meu, here, however,
the word is used in a general sense-Familia et propinquitates.
“Familias and kindreds.” Eichhom appears Ιιο be in error when
he thinks that these bore more analogy to the Roman gentes than
to relationship oi blood orwedlock. (staats ond Βιοιιε Gracia, i.,
