the ranks of the legion).” Tacitus is speaking here not cf levying
soldiers, but of the promotion of recmits to the honoros sarving iu
the legion through private favor (studiis priumie), or on the recom-
mendation of the centurions. The term milites in its full force be·
longed only to the legionary troops. The tirones thought much of
the honor of sarving in the legion, and frequently importuned the
centurionsforthispromotion. Thepmdeuceofhgricolamccording-

Vegetius: “ Legianum amaru ia caeram permanet hodieque, scd prr

Sed optima quasique, dac. ‘⁶ But he thought each best man the

punish all.” Observa that exsequi, in the seusa of alcisci, is found
not only in writers of this age, but in Livy, iii, 25, and v., ll. This
meaning is deduced naturally enough from the literal signification
of “to follow out.”

Commodaret “Ha applied.” There is no need‚asWalther cor-
rectly remarks, of regarding this, with Waloh, as an instance of
neugma. The meaning we have here given to thc verb, and which
is closely allied to its literal one, will suit equally well both veniam
and seueritatem-Nec parra semper, sed sapius, dac. “Nor was he

repentance.” Tbere is no nce'd whatever of our supplying ari with
parra, as Ernesti does. Cicero has supplicio coatrutur (r'n Verr,
ii.. 37), and we need not object, therefore, to parra coutantur in tha
present instance.

fairly, according to their property, that the poor might not have to

to poll-taxes and taxes upon property. These were increased, and,
