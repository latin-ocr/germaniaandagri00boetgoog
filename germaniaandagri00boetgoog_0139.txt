quieu derives from this the origin os ameclage. At first the priuos
gave to his nobles arms and provisions. As cupidity increased,
money, and then lands, were required, which last, from beneficas

Illambellotoremequum. “Thatwar-steed.”' The prouounishere

meant to express gesture, or a pointing at the object sought to be
obtained. So,likewise, illem in the succeeding clause. Observa,
moraover, the expression bellatorem equum, and compare Virgil,
Gerra.. ii., 145: “Hinc bellator equas campo sese arduus infert.'’
consult, also, Bottieher‘s remarks on the poetioal complexion of the
style of Tacitus-Nam epolc e³t cuneatus, dec. “ For banquets and
couimon tables, although homely, yet marked by abundant supply,
tale the place of pay.” We have followed here the reading of the
earlier editions, by which largi apparatus becomes the genitive of
quality (Zumpt, olid). This is also given by the Bipont editor,
aud hy Passow, Hess, Dilthey, and others. The other reading is
as follows: ‘⁴ Nam epulo ct, quamquam incomti largi tanuen appara·
tua‚'’ dac. “For banquets and entertainments, although homely,
Ι ¹yet plentiful, take the place os pay.” In this latter, apparatcabe·
comes the nominative plural. The former reading, however, is un-
doubtedly the true one. The pay os the companions did not consist
in mere occasional banquets, but in their sharing a daily table with
the leader, or, as the term amicatus literally means, “ a living with”
him This common table, always plentitully supplied, was occa-
sionally rendered still more so by a banquet on a large scale.
