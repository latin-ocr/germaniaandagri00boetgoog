Decurrims Aoni. Α name applied to lands conquered by the
Romans, in which, ior the sake os security, that no hostile tribe
might dwell close to their hordeis, they allowed Gaulo or Roman
soldiers to settle, who were charged with the payment os a tithe
(deciam) to the Romans. The Romans very commonly exacted'a
tithe from those who occupied the public lando: the greater part ot'
Sicily was taxed in this way. (Compare Aac, xiii, 54; Oea, B.
G, vi., 23.) The ⁴situation os these lands is¹ variously laid down.
Some authors place them on the banks of the Nealcen· others he·
tween the Lala ond the Moira and on tho hanlrs of tho Danube,
opposite the province oiRretia; or within the Roman vallum, reach-
ing from Mogontiacum to tho Danube, near the source oi which lay
the territorias oi the Marcomanni, which the Romans took posses-
sion os atter Maroboduus removed to Bohemia. Dmsus Germani·
cus, having built a tort on Mouot Taunus, seems to have laid the
first foundation oi the limes inelosing the Decumates agri, which
was gradually advanced, especially by Trajan and Hadrian, and sor-
tihed. Though the occupation oi these lands depended on the will
os the emperors, towns gradually sprung up in them. There are
still remains of a Roman wall running from Iagotstadt, on the Dan·
ube, past fflnlabbthband OEbnngea, to the Maia. Toward the end
oi the third century these lands were wrestod from the Romans by

- · the Alemanni, whom Julian and Valentinian in vain endeavored to

Dunoraim. A German tribacahcd Δουλγούμνιοι by Ptolemy,
who places them on the eastern bank os the Weser, in the southern
part oi Calcabarg, and the western hals os Gradenbagan. But thls
wa's not the position io which Tacitus knew them.v He places them
in the rear oi the Chamavi and Angrivarii, in what was once the
‘ territory of the Bmeteri; aud their territorias, according to thio,
would lie between tho' Eme and the lappe, where the town os Dol-
gibinum (Dalmata) was situated. They belonged to the cherusci,
and were apparently driven eastward bytho same emptiones the
Oauci as that which expelled tho Angrivarii. (Ptol, ii, ll ; soah,
