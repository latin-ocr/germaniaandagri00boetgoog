Gutum crebris imbribus, dcc. A remark still fully applicable to the
climate of Britain. Strabo says that the sun generally shone there
only sor afew hours, and that in the morning aud erening it was
hid in clouds or fogs.-Arperr'trs frigorum otest. Compare Coe·
sar (Β, G, ν, 12): “ Loca runt temperatiore qnam in Gallia, remis-
sioribus frigoribus⁷’-Uhra nostri orbis mensuram “Beyond the
measure of those os our part os the world.” For ultro mensuram
dierum nostri urbis. Elliptieal expressions os this kind are not uu· ¹
common. Pliny says that in Italy the longest day lasts fifteen
honrs; in Britain, serenteen. (H. Ν, ii., 75.)

Quod si nudes nnn ficiunt, &c “They say that provided, there·
fore, clouds do not interpone, the brightness os the suu is secu dur-
ing the night, and that it neither sets nor rises, hut moves across
the sky.” Is hysulgor sotir we could understand the light arising
from the refracted rays of the sun, this would be strictly true ; hut
the words nec occidere ..... scd transire are hardly applicable to
this, and must refer to the sun himself. The same idea occurs in
Eumenius (Puncg. in Conon, 9), “ Ut sol ipsc, qur' nohis uidetur oc·
cidere,idicpparcctpraetcrire.'’ ’ ⁴

frugum. For along time Britain was the granary for the Roman
army on the Rhiue. Zosimus (iii, 5) speaks of eight hundred vcs-
sels employed, hy order os the Emperor Julian, in transporting coru
to Germany. (Compare Arum. Marcell, xviii, 2, 3, aud Voles, ad
loch—Tarde mitescunt, duc. “They ripen slowly, they corne forth
quiokly,'' i. a, growth is quiclr‚ but maturatiou elon. With mites-

Coli. “The atmosphere.” compare Pliny (H. N.,ii.,38): “Nam-
quc ct truc celum appellavere majores qnod alio numine circ, omne quod
uitali simile vitalem nnnc spiritum fundit.”

Fert Britannicarum, dcc. Strabo (iv, p. 1³8) agrees with Tae-
itus. Cicero, ou the contrary, says, “Illud cognitum est, neque ar-
genti scripulum essc ullum in illc insulu.’' (Ep. ad Act, iv, 16.)
Gambdeu speaks os gold mines in Cumherland and scotland, aud ol
