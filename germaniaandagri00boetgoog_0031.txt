IV. Tacitus is also remarkable for great copionsness aad variety os
words ς because, besides the words received in common use, he like·
wise frequently uses such as are sonnd only in single passages in the
writers of the former age3 because, too, he adopted those words
with which the poeta os every age, and the writers of his own time,

' enriched the Latin tongue; and, lastly, because he himself discor· ·

ered and composed many new words; as, centurionatus, destinatam,

instigatrix, inturbidus, quinquiplicure, prepoue, proeium, pevigcre,
superaagaare, superaugeri. And he ,followed the same plan rr rna
susurros or wonns, not only combining the different sensas which

they hadat different times, but also referring thena according to his
own laste, to other things which bore sonna degree of affinity to the
things which other writers had used those words to express. 0f this
Ι will give the ¹following examples: ¹

⁶ a. As in Cicero we read adducere auena, in Seneca adducas sub
tum ad tn'ssstitiam, in Quintilian addsseta fresis,- so in Tacitus, with s
slight change in the meaning of the word, Ama, xii, 7, adductum
„f (i.e.,seoesum,rigidum)etquasioirilsseroitium,· xiv„ 4, familiaritate ⁸
juvenili-et πωπω adductuu and Tacitus alone appears thus to have
used tha adverb, adductius (regnari, busalese), in Germ„ ³4, and

Hes, iii, 7.

b. Expedire, 1. As in its common nse, is the aime ss preparare,
perorans ariao, alimenta, iter, ronedum Ausul„ xiv„ 55, qus' sss soa
matum precisa, ssd subita expedire docuisti, concoming facilityof
speech. 2. Then in the same sense es emouere: exemplos of this
meaning are furnished by Terence, Virgil, and other poels3 Ausul„
iv, 1, uuus originem, mores-aspidium, and so frequently. 3. Tacitis
alone appears to have used it absolutely for expeditionem Μάρσης
sliu, i., 10. sesemetipsum eum massis qucum repetierat mag·

in tha same way, ducere is used sorduisse sueciam, not only by Tac·
itus, but much oftener by Livy.

c. Eatenus, besides its common nse, in which it simply applies te
