third consulate was in the year ⁷9³3 the consulate of collega und
Priscus in ³46. According to this, therefore, Agricola would have .
died in the fifty-fourth year of his age, being fifty-three years, two
months, and ten days old. Το get over this difficulty, some suppose
that Tacitus wrote LIV, and not LVI; others, that he wrote pri·
nrum instead of tatium. The first consulate of Ouligulu was in 790.

(augeo) says of Angustus : “Consulatumeicerimo cutia enno inve

completed his twentieth year. Livy (Ep, 119), on the contrary, says
“ Nouum decimam ogem,’' of ayouth who was abore uineteen years

20), he must hare then completed his twenty-ninth year. Taking
the extreme case, if he was pretor after August aad, 820, be must
