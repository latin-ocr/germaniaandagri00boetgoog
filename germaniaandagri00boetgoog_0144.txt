matrimonia lamam? Lips, illle-Murum probam “ Pasa their
approbation on the presents,’' i. e. examine into their sufficiency.
Macerones od delicias milliebres quaele. “ Presents not selected
to gratisy a female taste.’' Liternlly‚ “not selected· sor female de·
light (in them),’' i. e, not such presente as necldaces, bracelets, fine
attire, dic. The repetition os munero appears objectionahle'here,

especially as lec monere follows soon aller. Consult Balleia, ad
loc-Goroalor. “May be adorned.’' Cimo is not derived from
omna, ‘⁴ the hair,’' hut is compounded olco (corr) eudemo, andsignifies,
therefore, “to put together,’' “arrange'’ ⁶⁴ adorn.‘’ It is aword

especially applied to the female sex. Compare Terence (Heaut, ii,
2, 11): ‘⁸ Dum resolidatur, dum comuntur, urraca csl.'‘

Ia loe munero. “ On these presente being given.” Some, less
correctly, make in here denote a condition, like ἐπὶ in Greek, with
the dative—Hoc morionem vinculum, &c “This they regard as

these simple bridal presente. (Compare Moldenltawer, Altertlt, p.
66⁰, seqq.)

fortitude, and exempt srom the casualties of war.” Commentators
call our attention to the words ⁴¹ bellorum coros putet, ipsis incipien-
ἤιξ’ as forming an hexameter verse. So also “ Urbem Romam,”
etc. (Arra, i, l).-Accr'pere ee, qua liberis inviolato, duc. “That

‘ceptanoe to her children, what her daughters-inlaw are to receive,
end, in their turn, transmit to her grandohildren.” Editors differ
in opinion respecting both the reading and interpretation os this pass·
nge. We have given what appears to be the least objectionablo
oue. The allusion can not, ol course, he to the juncti lover and
