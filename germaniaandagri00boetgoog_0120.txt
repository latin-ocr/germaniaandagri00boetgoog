(ἴωσι. Ait. Drutruhl, p. 388.) Another, but erroneone form of the
word, is barritus, retained in the Glossary oi Duruuge, ut. Heraclei,
p. 60⁷, but very properly condemned by Freund (Whrturh, r. o.)
This last-mentioned writer, moreovcr, is of opinion that Tacitae
bere erroneously gives the name os the war-cry sor that os the war·
song. Several MSS. and editions read harditum, but there is no au·
’ thority to show that bards, as such, existed among the Germane,¹
They formed rathere Celtic caste or order. (compare Vrget, iii,
1⁸3 Auum. Marcell, xvi, 30 ;, xxvi, 7.) .

that a person, on hearing this martial strain, would think he heard,

Fructum murmur. “A broken rcar.’' The term murmur isnot
unfrequently employed to denote a low sullen roar, like that oi the
sea, thunder, an earthquake, duc. (Compare Fruuud, Whrtcrh, c. ο.)
-Quo plenior rt ςτοοὶοτ, duc. “In order that the voice may swell
forth fuller and more sonorous, in consequence os the repercussion.”
