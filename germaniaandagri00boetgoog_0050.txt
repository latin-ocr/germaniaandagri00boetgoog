ΟΝ THE Perimula COMPLEXION OF THE STYLu'or
TAOITUS.

That there was among the Greeks in the mest ancient times a
great resemblance between th'e poete and the historica] writers, is
sufficiently proved by that well-known comparison in which we are
went to speak ef Homer, the father ef epic poetry, aa an authen re· ,
sembling Herodotus, while we call the latter the Homer ef history.
Among the Remm the plan of compesing history was different ς fer,
having at first attended only to the registeting ef annals, and having
thus been acenstomed to set mere value on the facts themselves, than
on the expression ef the feelings which meve the mind in narrating
and judging ef the several events, when afterwsrd they were led en,
chiefly by the example ef the Greeks, to aspira to mere perfect skill
in the art ef writing history else, they then sought mere after the
ornaments ef rhetoric than ef poctry. And thus, indeed, yeu would
juatly mention Titus Livius as the most perfect model among all the
Reman historiens, and as the author who chiefly establishes the

ability ef the Romans fer that species ef composition, and, above all,
as far exoelling those writers who, like Lucan, Silius, and others,

by doing little mere than narrating events in stiff language, lessened
the gravity ef epi'c verse and burt the dignity ef history, while they
in vain affected poetieal lenguage in erder to ornament their recorda
ef bare facts. Tacitus alone, among all these writers, is worthy to be'
compared with these Greeks3 because he sought net poetical erna-
ments from without, but was strong in the power ef his own genius,
aud in the innate poetieal sublimity ef his mind. And as Herodotus ·
presents te us the likeness ef the epic, se dees our author'chiefly that ¹
ef the lyrie and mamatic misse, by arranging every event he reeerds
after the manner ef a tragic poet, and in all things expressing the im·
pulses ef his own mind, noy, even the inmcst feelings ef his seul.
When, as we read his annals end historias, we see the efforts made
by men worthy ef a better age against the cruelty of princes and the Ι
commen corruption ef manners falling fruitless to the ground, but yet
pereeive, attha same time, that there can be geed and brave men even
under evil rnlers3 when we behold fortune, fate, nay, the gods them·
selvas, ruling in a wonderful and ever inscrutable manner the divers
chauces of human events, as we contemplate in his books ef anneis
the fatal extinctien of the Julian raee, and in his historias the mighty
efforts to establish anew an empire already desolate and falling; de
we net seem te ourselves te be reading seme tragic composition, such

ss these ef AEschylns, Sophocles, Euripides? is net the memntirl
lmage ef a Niobe presented before cur eyesl are net our seuls pen ⁴
