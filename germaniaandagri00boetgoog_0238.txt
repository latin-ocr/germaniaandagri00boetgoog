which the Usipii sailed, were astonished at the wonderful sight,

to suppose that these Usipii were forced by stress oi weather into
the Baltic Sea. The name Suari was borne by many tribes (Germ,

either when attempting to reach their native country by land, or
endeavoring to work their way round ou the wrecks os their vessels,
they were intercepted by some Saevi, and these, in turn, captured
by some Frisian pirates. That piracy in these quarters was oi very
ancient origin is proved hythe example os Gannascus (Ana, xi,
