dition was the same as that ottho vassals, or seris, who a saw cen·
turies ago made up the great body os the peoplc in every country
in Europe. They were attached to the soil, and went with it like
the Roman coloni, and hence we see why each had an abode (redeo)
os his own, and regulated his own household affairs (onor poncia). ,ί

The Germanis, ata later period, imitating the Romans, had slaves
of inferior condition, to whom tha name of slave became appropri-
ated3 while those in the state os rural rassalege were called Men ·
(liti or Litonee). (consult Grimm, Danaeia Recitsoltertliinnr,p.
300, seqq.)

= Ut enimn. ‘⁴ As upon a tenant,” i. e, as upon one ot' those whom
we Romans term coloni. The term colonas is here employed in the
sense which it had during the later imperial period. The coloni paid
a certain yearly rent for the land on which they lived, and were at·

period in household duties, but used sor this purpose the cervicosos

their own wives and children. (Orelli, od loo.) Observemoreover, ,

Verberon ancum, duc. Tacitus opposes this to the cruelty of
masters among the Romans. Various laws were enacted by Ser·
vius Tullius, Augustus, Hadrian, and others, to oheck the cruclty
of the Romans toward their slaves. (consult Seneca, cle Iro, iii,
