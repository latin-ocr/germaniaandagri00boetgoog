8, innuebatur facilc meretum exsilium delecta Lesbo (quod facile
toleraturus esset): Hist, ii.. 74, cetere-legiones merere spectantur
(sperabanurr fore ut sequereamr).¹ 'Phe perfect passive participle is
used for the finite tenses cl the verb: deest.. vi, 32, cupitum et
Talaria, 6 s, cupiebat; and sc it takes the place cf a substantive (as
in Plautus); Achab, ιιι, 3, nepotes adelti mmam cupiri« adserebant.
The neuter cf the future passive participle is joined with the verb

6.- Ablatives which are called absolute are used in aa unusual way,
aud geserdly elliptically; hut examples of the same thing are not
wanting in the older writers. The most uncommcn case is that cf
the ιιιιιιι active participle employed' ιιι this way· Htet, ii, 3ss ιιι·
