ignorantia. Some editors take circam trepidos to be equivalcnt to
droam trepidantes, or trepide ciream uagantes, while others atrike out
circam. But that would be equivalent to saying, Qui nan solnm orn·
nino trepidi eant ignorantia, verrent etiam ignorant, qaae in aceto, deo,
appareant. Most probably some such word as locorum, aaran, or
regionam has been lost before ciream. Circam must theu be taken

Ana, ii, 38: “ Hae plures per silentiam aret occultant marmur eree·
pere.”—Jonqne agnina, dic. Supply apparent. The ellipsis ofthis
verb is common in *Tacitus-Ananiam cujusque procurro. ‘⁴ Iu*
