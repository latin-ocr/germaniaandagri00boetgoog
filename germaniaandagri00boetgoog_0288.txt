ning northward till it crosses the Maia, then eastward, comprising
what are now called the Sprcoart Wald and dioclea Wald, through
Bohemia and the north of Hungary. (Oce, Β. G, vi, 25; Strabo,
vii, p. 207, 290, 292; Plin, xvi, 23 Ptol, ii.‚ 11.) These writers,
however, do notall quite agree in their description. Ptolemyas- Ι
signs much narrower limits to the name, and applies it to the ridge
between the Gabretan Forest and the Sarmatian Mountains, which
-unite the Carpathian and Sudetan Mountains. Cesar's account of
it was derived from report. At a later period, the Romans, in their
wars with Maroboduus, whose possessione lay among the Bdhmer
Wald Mountains, became personally acquainted with it. Different
ndrnes were asterward given to the several subdivisione of this

chain. Silva Marciana was the Schwarz Wald, or Black Forest: ¹,

this name became known to the Romans in their war with the Al·
lemanni; it is found in the Peutingerian Table. The Helvetii had
inhabited it in former times, but were expelled by the wandering
Suevi; Ptolemy called it τὴν Ἐλουηττῐων ἔρημον. The name Ab
noba, which belongs to 'the ridge in which the Danube rises, was
given by Ptolemy to a chain of mountains which he makes to run
parallel to the Rhine, from the Main to the source of the Amisia
(Em), which, according to him, rises in it. From Ficlrtelberg east-
ward, through Bohemia to Moravia, where it meets with the Her·
cynian chain, runs aridge called by Ptolemy Mount Sudeta. South
of this, following what is' now called the Bahmer Wcld, but extend·
ing toa greater breadth toward the north, lay the Gabretan Forest
(ὴ ratpero ὕλη). On each side of the River March lay the Forest
of Luna. The most eastern range, extending from-the Danube,
where it turns southward, to the Carpathian Mountaina,is called by
Ptolemy the Sarmatic Mountains. These arethe mountains aad!
