Multam venatiles. The MSS. have non multum, but the negativo
has been rejected from the text by many editors, at tha suggestion
cf Lipsius, who in this way seeks ιο reconcilc the account of Tac·
ittrs with that os Cesar (B. G, vi, 21), where we find it stated oi
the ancient Germana, that ‘⁴ Vita omnis invocationibus atque ia
studiis rei militaris eonciotit.” So, again (Β. G, iv, 1), it is said
of the ancient Saevi, that “ multam cunt ire venationibuo.'’—Per otium.
‘⁴ Arnid total inactiop.” Observa here the employment οι per with
the accusative, after an ablativo (aeremitae) in the previous and

⁴ corresponding clause. There appears to he more os continuancs

expressed by the proposition with its caso. Longolius citos ure
followinginstanc'esos this same peculiarityin othcrpartsos Tacitus:
“Per coiea amproserz'ptimffi (Aron, i., 2): “Per obsequium ......
yraeliio.” (Germ, c. tm: “Virtute out per artem.” (Agma, c. 9J:
“ Temeritate cut per igricrr'cm.‘' (It, c. 41.)

Delegoto donnae et penatium, &e “ The care os the house, aud fam·
ily affairs, and os the holds, having been given over ιο the women,”
&a ihc rerb delegare or legare properly means, “ ιο commission
another to act ior you.” The penates, in strictness‚ presided orer
the penus, or general receptacle of family stores; and also over the
operations by which focd was rendered more arailable sor human
· purposes'. Hence, eventually‚ they became the guardiam os family
affairs in general. It isin this sense that Tacitus transfers the
term srorn Roman to German customs. (Compara Virgil, AEn, i..
rot.)

Familia. Properly, “the gang os slaves.” Here, however, it
merely means “family”--Mira diversitate amora. “Bya strango
contrariety in their nature.”--Vel ornumornum oelfmgom. ‘¹ Either
a certain number of cattle, cr a certain quantity oi graiu.” Thess

Goodent. Referringtothe principes—Pluinna torquesque. “Rieu

Jam et pecuniam, &c The Romans had not only procurad tha
tnsndship of Ariovistus, Segestes, Malovendus, and others, iu this
way, but had also begun to purchase peace oi the Germans. (Vra.
chap. xlii, and compare Ana, ii, 135 Dr'o ears.‚1xvii.,r; lanitio.)
