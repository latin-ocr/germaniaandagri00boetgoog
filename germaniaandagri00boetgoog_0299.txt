Uslr. A German tribe, the allies ol Cesar against the Suevi,
and subsequently traumorted by Agrippa (EO. ³8) to the leit bank
of the Rhiue Their capital, called ut first Oppidum Ubiorum, was
afterward named Colonia Agrippina or Agrippinensis, when allo
man colony had been established there, first by Agrippa, and subse·
quently'by Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus and wife or* the
Emperor chudion. It is now Gologne. The Ara Ubiorum must
not be conlounded with the Oppidum Ubiorum. The former was
an altar, probably erected to Augustus, like that at Lugdunum (Suet,
Claud, 2). Not far from Bona is a hill called Godubrrg, and it is
highly prohable that this is the site of the Ara Ubiorum. That it
was somewhere near Bono is pretty certain 'dhe name Godes·
berg seems to indicate that the place was the seat of a religione

Usrrir. A German tribe, generally named in connection with the
Tencteri. lndeed, these two tribes, usually go together in both ge·

calls Snevi (B. G, iv, l, 4), aller wandering in Germany sor three
years, they came to the Tibine, and, having crossed it, seiaed upon
the lands and dwellings of the Menapii, Eburones, and Condnrsi,
between the Rhine and Mosella. From this point they spread fur·

slaughter, the greater part of the remainder perished in attempting
to cross the Rhine. Α part ol the cavalry, which had not been en·
gaged in the battle, took refuge in the territories ol the Sigambri.
When the Sigambri removed to Gaul, the Usipii and Tencteri he-
came masters of their possessione on the Lupia (Lippa). The
Usipii at first dwelt on the east bank of the Rhine, from its eastern
mouth to the Lippe, in the tract which the Chamavi and Tubantes
occupied before them; hut they gradually mered southward. In
the time of claudius and Nero they dwelt between tho δίας and
the Laba, where they were still in the time ol Tacitus. ln the
time ol Ptolemy they inhahited the northern part of the Black For-

ol Agricola; they became mixed up with the Alemanni. The
Tencteri lived south os the Lippe, in the region opposite Gela and

Bona. At the time ol the expeditione of Drusus and‘Tiberina thev
