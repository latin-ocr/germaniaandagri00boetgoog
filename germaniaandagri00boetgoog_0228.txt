poesim reperta, &c ‘¹ All those exactions having been abolished,

Namque per ludibrium msidm clausis imeis, doc. “For they
were compelled, lu mcckery, to sit hy the closed granaries, and to
buy, besides, their own corn, and to sell it out again at a (small)
fixed.price.’' The meaning os this passage hasbeen very generally
misunderstood. The explanation which we here give from Walch
will be found, on examination, to be decidedly the true one. From
'the provinces, at least during the times of the republic, and from
Sicily, the Romans procured corn in three different ways 3 namely‚
by means oi the frenantem dcccnwnum, mnam, aud estimatum.
(Consult cic. in Vera, Act. ii, lib. iii, 6-98.) The frumentum dc-
cumcncm was the tenth part cf the producens the ager publicas or
dccc-manns. lt was exacted from the cultivators without payrnent
(Asconius, cd Cic, Verr, p. 29), and had to be carried down to the
sea (Cic. in Verr, iii, 14); hut was generally purchased or con-
tracted ior hythe ravenue-farmani, who were thence called decu· ·
niani-and who either sent it to Rome or sold it in the provinces.
The ennom frumentum was corn which was furnished in compli-
ance with the orders os the proconsul, to supply the wants os the
armies or os the capital, aud for which a hxed price was paid, at
‘first from the public treasury, and alterward from that ol the emper·
or. When the governor os the province was in league with the
deomant, the latter, by means os such edicts as those mentioned by
Cicero (in Vera, ii, 3, 1a, 14), got all the corn in the country into
their power, as iu the case os the Britons alluded to in the text,
who were compelled to purchase it back fron] the Romans at a high
price, both ior their own consumption, aud in order to hirnish the
emtum sruntentcm, sor which they were paid only the small fixed
price. By haren, therefore, in the text, are meant the public or
Roman granaries, aud not, ae some most erroneously think, the
private oues of individuale. With 'regard to altro, ohserve that it
has here the force os insuper, or amplius, and concidi Bottiaia, Lea.
