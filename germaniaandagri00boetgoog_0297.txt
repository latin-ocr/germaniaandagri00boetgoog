anorhnr. A German tribe. Vid. Usrrrr.

Tamonns,orTnnron1. Tbe name oi the Teutones was made
known to the ancients by Pytheas oi Massilia (Marcellos), who, in
the age ol Alexander the Great, about 320 Rc, discovered anaticn
‘ of that name ln tbe Chersonesus Cimbrica, and on tbe adjacent
islanda, or in the present countries of Hohtaia, Scldenaig, Deamark,
and perhaps, also, in the southern extremity ol chden It seems
that tbsy had long been settled there, sor they lived in bouses, and
were acquainted with agriculture and commerce. Other traces os
the name appear later. Among ibe Celtic tribes which invaded
Greece and besieged Delphi, under the second Brennus (Rc. 278),

there was a people called Toutobodiaci, who atterward passed the .

Hellespont, and settled with the Celts in Galatia, in Asia Minor.

About ahundred and sixty years later, tbe 'Romans were attached
by tbe Cimbri and Teutones, who carne from the same country,
where they bad been seen by Pytheas. When the Romans first
heard the name or* the Teutones, theythought that they wereasingls
tribe. They did not know that it was also the general and ethno-
graphic name of all those natione to which they atterward gave the
designationes Germana. ’

The root ol the word Tanton is tia cr do, which originally repre·
sented the idea ol ⁴‘ activity,'‘ oi “ living, procreating, nourishing,”
and also os “ taming, educating, and ruling.’' 'From this root ars
formed the following words, some os which are still used in tbs
popular dialecto: Tcnr, “God, creator, ruler, father, nourisber”
(Utor, i'uisco) ; rior or iliad, “earth ;’' toti, dite, dote, ‘⁴ goduther ;”
toda, ⁴‘ nurse‘;” tiled, ⁴⁴ father os the people,’‘ “lord, ruler‚ king,” in
Gothic tiiudnna, in old Bavarian tbodoy diet, “ people,” in old Swe-
dish titiant and thyd‚· tiindinaaeaa, in Gothic, “ltingdom.” (Pisida,
waraei-wertweard). The names of king and os people being both
derived from one root, which expresses tbe notiones ruling, is a
sact which proves that they belong to the language os anation in
which there was neither absolute monarchical power, nor absolute
submission tc their chiefs. This corresponds exactly to ibe politi·
cai state oi the ancient Teutonic natium, among whom the sover-
eignty was in the peopie, and the executive power ol the chiess or
kings, although it was obeyed, was'always regarded as derived from
the people. The idea oi ruling, expressed by theroot Teuc, explains
