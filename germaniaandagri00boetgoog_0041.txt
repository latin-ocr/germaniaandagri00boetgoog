mabam (τῷ) quondam florentem—malielri frande cecidisse. See, On
rus Porrroan Ouerourion, dae, ΙΙΙ., c., y. Το the verbs desem
and incusare, theinfinitive is joined in the place of a genitive orsof
the particle quadr Aeaei, ii, 27, Libo Drusus defertur moliri res
noceas iii, 38, aeque minas Rhoemetalcen-inensam popularium iss·
jarim inultas sinere (compare below, On Gnncrsus). On the other
hand, qaod and at are sometimes employed in a more unusual man·
ner for the accusative with the infinitiva: creditam prod-walaiae&
quibas jusserat ret-resisterent. See above, d., near the end.

g. The iunroarrvn is often, even iu the obliqua aratia joined to
the particle dam,· as Annal, ii, 81, Piso orarit uti traditis amis
mariaci ia castellariam Cesar cui Syriam pemittant eonsrditw.
Former writers here seldom spoken thus; aud so, in general, the in- Ι
dicetire is found more frequently in Tacitus than in other historical
writers, when sentences are inserted in the obliqua oratio as if they
proeeeded from the miudes the writer himself3 as, Hira, iv, 16, ee
eam soloas, eui praerat-camalam compressam. No one, more·
over, has oftener used the indicative for the subjunctive, in that kind
of sentences which indicate that that which is implied in the condi·
tion had almost happened, as we¹ have it iu Livy, who notxunfre-
queutly speaks thus: iii, 19, aare risi Latini-arma sumsimeat-
delets‘ 'eramen we were lost. Generally alsi, more rarely si, joined
with the pluperfect, aud sometimes with the imperfect, begins the
condition, and the idea which is limited by it ofteuer precedes thau
follows in the imperfect, the pluperfect, and sometimes the perfect:
Arnai, xi, 10, reciperare Ameriam arebat, ai a Vilio Marso-eo·
libitus sor-etr i., 63, trudebanturque in paludem-ni Cesar-legiones
instruxisset ,· Hira, i., 16, si immerserat imperii eorpus stare-sine
rectore posset, dignm nam, a qao res publiea inciperet. Annae, xi.,
37, ai cadem eju-properaverat, aaran pernicies iss recreatorem
(thus (licere, preclare aiccramas,ssisi-Lepidus recepisset Antoniam).
Her, i., 64, prope in prelium exarsere, ai Valeas-admonuisset (thus
Liap, ii, 10, pons iter perse lsostibsss dedit, ni neue etr suisset). In·
stances conformed to the common usage of the lauguage are lem fre·
quentin Tacitus.

'lo the same class belongs the Erasinos or ras Inrsnrrcr raa
ren Psurreracr, which is also used ‘hy the older writers, as durrat,
xii, 37, si statim deditas traderer (traditas emam, mamm), seqre mea
fortunamque tua gloria inclaruisset. Compare Hist, i., 48, Piso
(interfectus) naam et tricesimam atatis aarum raplebat. In the uss
or rursus in general there is great force. The historiool present is
very frequently used (take as an example of all the rest, dnm, i.
21): following the writers of the former age, chiefly the poete, he
