cient Persian tribes (Herod, 1., 125), while the analogies between the
Persian and German are so striking as to have excited the attention
os every intelligent scholar. And, besides all this, an ancient Geor-
-gian Ms. of lawe, not long since brought tn light, proves con-
clusively that the Georgian uation had among them ordaals precisely
,similar tn those ol the early Germans, and also the same -judieial
forms os proceeding, and the same system of satisfactione to be
paid incuses ol homicide, according to the rank os the party elain. =

the whole subject, Krare'r Archiv der Germrntrcdm Volkeratiimrnc,
il, v·.124, seqq.) If these premises be correct, the commonly re-
ceived etymology of the name Germani, which makes it equivalent

to“war·men,’' or⁴⁴ warriors,” falls, os course,tothe ground. (con- .

sult notes on chapter il), lt may uot be amiss, however, aller
having stated what appears to be the most prohahle view of the
1 subject, to give a lew other etymologies sor the name Germani, each
os which has its advocates. Thus, Althamer makes Germanus
equivalent to ‘⁴ iorndprorsus virilia,” and the same, in fact, as Am·
man, 'n e., Gens-Mona. Wackernagel, on the other hand, explains
Garamans by G'ermnrmr, i. e., Vult-grenones. Luden {hinks that the
term Germanicis nothing more thanthe German Welrrrrmnner', and
that there were several such Germanic, or ⁴‘ confederacies” (Eidage-
nosremclrastrn), such as those of the Cherusci, the Catti, the Cauri,
dre. ; and hence the uniones all os these would form what he terme
·⁴ Geaammtgermonienl’' (Geruli. der Deciatium, i., p. 163.) And,
finally, the name Germani is supposed hy some to he derived from
ger, which, according to them, appears in the French guerre, ‘⁶ war,”
and mon. (Compare the etymological remarks under the article

Teutones.)

Our information concerning the geography of ancient Germany is
very scanty and uncertain. The Greek aud Roman writers, from
whom our knowledge ol it is derived, knew very little about it them-
selves. A knowledge os the German Ocean, and the northern parts
of Europe, had been acquired, first by the Phoenicians and Cartha-
ginians, who proeured tin from the cassiterides or from Britain, and
amber suom the shores os the Baltic (sea c. 45); and, in the year
B O. 400, by Himilco the Carthaginien, whose voyage hasbeen de-
scribed by the poet Avienus (Plio, ii, 67); in Bc. 113(1,,1>)1 Hecatoeus
and Philemon (Ptin, iv, 13, or 27), and about the same time, by
Ephorus and clitarchus-(serat, vii, t, 1, p. 293) ; by Timaeus, Xen-
