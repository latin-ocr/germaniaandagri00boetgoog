suis agentem, dre. ‘¹ Had destroyed -almost to a man the troop of ·

horse actirig within their confines.’' The atu was the body of cav-
alry belonging to the legion, in number generally about three hun·
dred. Agamem marks that there was a fixad camp. The period
between the departure os Frontinus nnd the arrival of Agricola,

when the island was without a governor, probably afforded the op- .

’ portunity sor this occurrence. ,

quue initio eructu prouincia, drc. “And hy this beginning the
inhabitants os the province being thrown into a state os anxious sus·
pense, inasmuch as 1 war was what they wished sor, either approved
ot the example, or waited to learn the ieelings os the new governor,'’
i. a, or withheld their determination till they had ascertained his
feelings. The meaning is, that some did the one, and some the
, other. Ut qui generally, and always in Livy, is joined with the
subjunctive mood; but sometimes with the indicative. Observa,
moreover, the imitation os the Greek idiom in ut quibus 1111111υοί11-
tibus erut, where the regular Latin sorm ot expression would have
been ut qui balbum uolebant, and compare Kiibuar, G. G, b 599, b, ed.
Jetf. So we have in Sallust (Jug, 84), “ Neque plebi militia volumi
putubatur,·” aud (c.100), “Uti militibus exequutus aum imperatore
intervolantibus assat,·” and, again, in Livy (xxi, 50), “ Quibusdam
aobntibus mous res fore.”

Numeri. “The forces.” The term numanaishere employedin
its military sense, a meaning which appears to have come in during
the reign os Augustus. lt is well explained by Torrentius (ud Sitit,
Vasp, 6): “Eat militare uocabulum uon solum pro catologo seu brt·
viculo militum, quum atium matriculam omont, aad pro ordinibus ipsis
turmisque at cohortibus militum.” Walch renders it here “ the co·
borts‚” but this appears too limited, the reference being ratberto va-
rious subdivisione and bodies ot troops. Buttieher, therefore, trans·
lates, more correctly, “dia Truppcnubtbailuugau.”—Pruaumto apud
militem, &a “Inactiou for that year was anticipatsd among tho
soldiery.’'-Tardu attentioris billum inchoaturo. “circumstances ,
which delay and thwart one who purposes tc commones war.”
This must bo taken as a parenthesis independcnt ot quamquam--
Custodiri suspecto. “ That the suspected parts oi the country should
be watched merely‚'' iss a, those parts where the inhabitants wera
suspected ot an intention to tbrow off the Roman yoke.

contractisque legionum uexillis. “And having drawn-together the r
veterane os the legions.’' Observe that canillis is here sor vexillariis.
On comparing all tho passages where the semitarii aud 1111111 legio-
