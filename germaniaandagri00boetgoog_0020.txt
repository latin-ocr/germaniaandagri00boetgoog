The ‘Life of Agricola’ was not contained in the earliest editione of
Tacitus.

“ The ‘Germany’ of Tacitus has been the subject of some ὰίοοοοοὶοα
ss to its historica] valae. The author does not inform ns whence he ⁸
drew his materiale for the description of the usages of these barbari·
ant, many of whom could only be known by hearsay even to the
Roman traders and adventorem on the frontiers of the empire. The ⁸
work contains numerous minute and precise details, for which it must
be assumed that the writer had at least the evidence of persons con·
versant with the German tribes on the finntiers; and there is nothing
in the description of Tacitus which is substantially at variance with
what we know of the early Germans from other sources. The sound-
est conclusion is, that the picture of the Germans is in the main cor·
rect; otherwise we must assumsit to be cithera mere fiction, or a
rhetorical essay founded on a few generally known factet but neither
of these assumptione will satisfy a carefal render.

“The ‘Historias’ which were written before the ‘Ananis’ and
aller the death of Nerva, comprehended the period from the accession
of Galba to the death of Domitiam tb which it was the anthor’s in·
⁸ tention to add the reigns of Nervaiand Trajan (Hist, i., 1). There
are only extant the first four books and a part of the fifth, and these
oomprehend little more than the events of one year, from which we
may conclude that the whole work must have consisted of many
books. Unfortunately, the fifth book contains only the commence-

ment of the siege of J ekusalem by Titus.
“The ‘Annals’ comprehended the history of Rome from‘the death

of Augustus to the death of Nero, a period of fifty-two years, which*
ended with the extinction of the Julian house m N'ero. A part of the
fifth book of the⁴ Annals'' rs lost· the seventh‚ eighth, ninth, tenth,
the beginning of the eleventh, and the end of the sixteenth and last
book ,are also lost. These last portione comprehended the whole reign
of Caligula, the first years of Claudius, and the last two years ol Nero's ·
reign. Itis said that the preservation of the historical works of
Tacitus rs due to the Emperor Tacitus (Vopisc, Tacit, 10), who
caused them to be transcribed ten times a year, and copies to be
placed in the libraries. Bnt the works of-Tac'itus, and more¹ partiou-
larly the ‘ Annals,’ were neglected during the decline of the empire,
and few copies of them were preserved. The first five books of the
‘Annals’ were not found till the beginning of the sixteenth century, Ἴ
when they were discovered in the Abbey of Oorvey, in Westphalia,
and published at Rome, in 1515, by Philip Bervaldus.

“The Dialogus on the Decline of Eloquence may have been writ-
ten in the reign of Vespasian: it is at least probable that it is an early
