according to the nature of the context. The phrase is employed to
denote mere possibility, without any definite assertion. (Compare
Waltlter, ud Aoo, ii, 633 Hand, cd Turseli, vol. iv, p, 239.)

Taisconcm deum lt was customary with almost all ancient com·
munities, iu their national songs, to trace their pedigree tc some
god or deilied hero. The name Taleae is very probably connected
with that of Teutones, which occurs iu various forms; as Theotisci,
Theotisci, Tuirsclti, and, in the old dialects of Germany, Teut, Tuit,
Thiuda; intheBelgic‚Doitsclte,Doislce. (Compare Gramm, Daorseis
Gramm. Eirslsit, p. 13, seq„- aud consult Geograph. Iudex, r. ο.
Teutones.)

Mannum. Marinus, the son of Tuiseo, is merely a personificatiou
oi the German man (mnne), or race, aud the three sous of Mannus
are the three main geographical divisione oi this raoe.

Ingoeemscs. The Ingsvones, who are here described as dwelliug
ou the Ocean, are “the inhabitants of the inber coasts,” i. a, the
Inbswohnem and, in like manner, the Istaevonee, whom Pliny (Η. N,
iv, 14) speaks of as being “proximi Rheno,” are ‘⁴ the inhabitants of
the waram parts,’' i. e, the Werlbewoitner. Is this etymology be
correct, the penults os both names ought to be regarded as long.
(Compare Monam, Geogr, vol. iii, p. 145, seqq.) As· regards the
appellation Herminones, itis probable that it contains the root oi tbe
national name Garanum, namely, Herm, or Gberm- (i. a, Hermin-
ones, Gbermun-ones), ir we suppose, as many now do, that this
name is of Oriental origin. (Compare the remarks of Von Hammer,
an. Jahrb, vol. ii, p. 319 ; and vol. ix, p. 39.) According to this
explanation, the Herminones will be the main or parent stem oceu-
pying the central parisos the country. A less correct reading is
Hermiones.

Mentis vetustatis. “Through the (usual) license oi antiquity,”
i. a, availiug themselves of the lieense which so remote a period
affords ior hazarding bold speculatious.

Plures deo ortos. With deo supply illo, the reference being to
Tusce—Marsos, Gambrivios, duc. (Consult Geographical Iudex.)
The MSS. vary with regard to the name Gambrivios. The true
reading probably is Marsos, Sigambros. (Consult Woither, ad loe.)

Ceterum Germanice vocobulum, &a “Thai the name oi ‘Ger-
many,’ however,'is of ancient origin, and lately added,” i. e.,is a
comparatively modern addition. According to the account here
cited by Tacitus, the name Gemoniis the Latiuized form bi the ap-
pellation assumed by the Tungri, the first German tribe that crossed

the Rhine; and they gave themselvesthis name in order to striks
