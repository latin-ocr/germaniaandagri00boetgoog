formidable idea respecting it.

sud the previous sentence is purposely suppressed by the writer,
from motives of brevity, and must be supplied by the reader: “Some
one here may say, ‘Let uc tter asle tte oid os other natione’ but there
is no oetion beyond us,¹’ dec-Et infestiores Romani. “And (on
the other side are) the Romans, still more hostile (even than these),'’
